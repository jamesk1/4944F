"Few on Capitol Hill know the details of the legislation being drafted behind closed doors to put flesh on the skeletal tax overhaul framework released by Republican leaders last month  Many lawmakers are hesitant to endorse the efforts because they know so few details about what will actually be in the tax bill Even President Donald Trump appears to be largely in the dark about the bill  If the president’s vagueness about the tax overhaul in speeches intended to promote it led to suspicions that he did not have the details ready at hand, his rejection of a plan under consideration by GOP tax writers to cap contributions to 401 k  retirement plans confirmed them  If the president had been fully briefed on the issue, surely it would have been killed quietly instead of requiring a public tweet by the president to shoot it down This pattern of secrecy, leaked details of major changes to popular programs, and public criticism from the president is all too familiar to Republic lawmakers  It is exactly what happened as the GOP moved and failed to repeal and replace Obamacare The irony is that repealing and replacing Obamacare was supposed to be a layup for the GOP that would make tax reform easier  Instead, it appears to have created a template for legislative failure that the GOP keeps trying If madness is doing the same thing time and again while expecting a different result, the GOP leadership on Capitol Hill is a Mad Hatter’s Tea Party Also familiar from the Obamacare debacle are the divisions among Republicans  Deficit hawks worry that tax cuts on businesses will not be  paid for  by tax hikes elsewhere, Blue State GOP lawmakers object to plans to end deductions for state and local taxes, anti tax libertarian types worry that closing some loopholes and deductions might raise some tax bills, and populists worry that the Republican tax bill will shift more of the tax burden to the American middle class The child tax credit is one issue where GOP lawmakers depart  Some lawmakers are pushing back on expanding the child tax credit, saying it would expand the deficit without contributing to economic expansion, according to people familiar with the matter  But without an expanded childcare tax credit, the GOP bill might end up raising taxes on many middle class families House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady has said his goal is to release the tax legislation on November 1  House Speaker Paul Ryan has vowed to get the bill through the House by Thanksgiving  But even if both those timetable goals are accomplished, that would make it challenging to get a deal done with the Senate before the holidays and year’s end "

" Last month, I promised a recommitment to free speech on campus and to ensuring First Amendment rights  The Justice Department continues to do its part in defending free speech, protecting students’ free expression, and enforcing federal law,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a press release accompanying the action Kevin Shaw, a student at Los Angeles Pierce College, is suing the Los Angeles Community College District after, he alleges, he was told to leave campus for setting up a table to hand out Spanish language copies of the United States Constitution outside Pierce’s  Free Speech Area  According to Shaw’s complaint, a large protest was allowed in the same area he distributed Constitutions with no consequences  As the DOJ puts it in its statement of interest,  T he College enforces its speech restrictions  selectively and unevenly’ by allowing speech outside the designated area in some instances but prohibiting it in others A statement of interest is a legal brief expressing that the United States considers there to be a major constitutional interest at play in a case to which it is not a party  Here, the DOJ, in 27 pages, makes the case that it believes Shaw has made an adequate showing that his First Amendment rights were violated by Pierce College’s policies and their application, arguing Mr  Shaw’s allegations, if proven, demonstrate that Pierce College’s speech policies and practices, which the College applied to deny Mr  Shaw his right to engage in expressive activity in a public forum, imposed prior restraints that were not narrowly tailored to further a significant government interest and failed to provide other alternative channels of communications Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made free speech on campus a focus of his department’s civil rights litigation   University officials and faculty must defend free expression boldly and unequivocally,  he said in a press release Last month, the DOJ issued a statement of interest in a similar campus free speech lawsuit, Uzuegbunam v  Preczewski  On the same day, Sessions agreed to speak before conservative and libertarian law students at Georgetown University Law Center on the topic of free speech on campus Predictably, dozens of other students and faculty protested the event, saying it was inappropriate for Sessions, the U S  attorney general, to speak at a law school   You cannot invite people who so thoroughly threaten the basic premises of American law to a campus and not speak up if your mission in life is to educate people about the American legal system,  Professor Heidi Li Feldman said at the time This case is Shaw v  Burke, 2 17 cv 02386 ODW PLA, pending the U S  District Court of the Central District of California "
"Gaffney said the current news environment provided a  target rich environment  for punditry, but was regrettably  hard on the country I particularly am thinking of this dossier business and the attacks on Donald Trump that have been relentlessly pursued,  he said   Interestingly enough, with the help   in some cases more than just help, the active participation   of some people who have prominently featured in an actual case of Russian collusion at the highest levels of the United States government You can’t make this stuff up,  he exclaimed   It’s an extraordinary tale  It’s worth exploring There now seems to be, at long last, a willingness on the part of congressional Republicans   amazingly    to conduct the kinds of investigations into this actual saga of collusion by Hillary Clinton, by Bill Clinton, apparently by the Democratic National Committee   and, by the way, by people like Robert Mueller, and James Comey, and Andrew McCabe, and Rod Rosenstein, and Eric Holder   These are people who have been prominently featured, either in condemning Donald Trump for the putative collusion of members of his campaign with the Russians, or are actively involved in the investigation thereof,  Gaffney explained   The trouble is, I don’t see how a one of these people, if they’re not actually going to be subject to criminal prosecution   and I say that advisedly   at the very least are now completely incapable of performing an independent and honest investigation into these so called allegations against Donald Trump Gaffney added that the latest developments in the story put another organization in the crosshairs  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States or CFIUS It is an inter agency group that has a critically important responsibility  That responsibility is to try to make sure that we are not selling off assets of this country that will have grievous national security implications  It’s got a whole cast of Cabinet officers as its members, including the Secretary of State, including the Secretary of the Treasury,  he said It turns out that as this so called Uranium One transaction was being considered by CFIUS for approval   this was, of course, the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium stocks to the Russians   and the voting on that idea was going to be conducted by, among others, Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder   then the Attorney General of the United States, she was the Secretary of State of course   Hillary Clinton was taking in, either personally or through her husband or through her foundation,  145 million dollars from Russian interests associated with this transaction,  he continued   And Eric Holder knew that  The Mueller team knew it at the FBI, Comey, McCabe, others, and Rod Rosenstein  This is scandalous in the first order  They did nothing to prevent this transaction  It went through  The Clintons were enriched  We sold, I believe, national security assets in the form of this uranium to Russians,  Gaffney charged   And CFIUS   get this   at the same time this was going down, a guy who was the staff director in effect of this organization, a fellow by the name of Amin Mir, is a Pakistani expat with sharia supremacist ties both personal and familial, including to the Muslim Brotherhood,  he added Now, you’ve just got to ask yourself, as the Pakistanis are all over this saga with the Capitol Hill Democrats IT scandal, who is in charge of actually monitoring what’s in the national security interests of the United States  Certainly not CFIUS  Certainly not the Attorney General, or the Secretary of State, or for that matter President Obama himself during this critical period of time,  he said Gaffney called for  public hearings, as well as investigations,  which he deemed likely to result in  criminal prosecution of at least some of these individuals At the bare minimum, they cannot in good faith proceed with their own investigations now underway   again, without evidence of actual collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russians,  he said   It is high time that the Washington Post get around to covering this  I’m delighted that they are  But let’s be honest, Raheem  this saga would not have gotten the attention that it has, finally, were it not for the work that you guys at Breitbart and the Daily Caller and others have been doing on it  It has to now go to the next step for sure on Capitol Hill On the crucial question of whether special counsel Robert Mueller has been compromised by the latest revelations, Gaffney replied,  Absolutely  Indisputably Here’s the charge  he knew that Hillary Clinton and her circle were involved in what can only be described as a pay to play scheme, and he did not bring that information forward at the time that the scheme was being essentially blessed by this organization, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  That’s malfeasance, I believe  That is certainly incompatible with the kind of assignment and responsibilities he now has,  Gaffney contended There are lots of good people in the FBI, thank God,  he reflected   But the leadership has been, I believe, corrupt for some time  Jim Comey, for example, has been called by many a  dirty cop ’ Bob Mueller has been shown now, I think, to be compromised  Andrew McCabe, for crying out loud, took money from Hillary Clinton’s best friend   through his wife, of course    750,000 while he’s investigating Hillary Clinton  You just can’t make this stuff up The people in the bowels of that bureau are poorly served, as is the country, by this kind of leadership,  he said   It’s high time that Donald Trump cleans the place out, I think As another example of corruption, Gaffney cited the case of  this Pakistani national at the heart of the CFIUS process,  linking it to how  Imran Awan and his family were deeply tied to a number of these members of Congress through IT services At the very time that the FBI is telling us that they’re satisfied   this is Jim Comey   that the Democratic National Committee’s computer services were penetrated by the Russians, it turns out that Imran Awan, who may have ties to Pakistani intelligence, by the way, had the passwords for Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s access to that system,  he said Gaffney cited Republican representatives in an informal meeting saying there is  much more evidence of Pakistan’s intelligence service being involved in the compromise of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC and so on than there is of the Russians And the FBI, under this corrupt leadership, claimed without actually investigating this computer system itself, the servers of the DNC itself   they took the word of, get this, a Russian tied company that indeed it was Russian involvement, not somebody else’s,  he continued   We’ve got so many strings to pull  We need rigorous congressional oversight  I pray the logjam is finally broken, that Paul Ryan will let that kind of work be done on the Hill, as it should have been long before now Kassam concluded by asking if it was time for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to  un recuse  himself from matters related to the 2016 election I think there’s plenty of things that he can do, including getting into the issues that we’ve just talked about now on Uranium One, for example, without un recusing himself,  Gaffney replied   Whether he can do that with respect to the rest of it, I just am not in a position to say We need his leadership on certainly the evidence of Hillary Clinton’s collusion, and Bill Clinton’s and the Clinton team’s, with the Russians on Uranium One and so much more,  he added   Skolkovo is another story which we’ll have to come back to some other day, I know  This is ripe for criminal investigation  We need it on the Hill, and probably in the Justice Department as well Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a m to 9 a m Eastern LISTEN "

"The company is based in Whitefish, Montana, the same small town where former Republican Congressman and now Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke hails from  The connection has inspired conspiracy theories in media reports about the deal The Washington Post reported about the  300 million contract For the sprawling effort to restore Puerto Rico’s crippled electrical grid, the territory’s state owned utility has turned to a two year old company from Montana that had just two full time employees on the day Hurricane Maria made landfall Whitefish said Monday that it has 280 workers in the territory, using linemen from across the country, most of them as subcontractors, and that the number grows on average from 10 to 20 people a day  It said it was close to completing infrastructure work that will energize some of the key industrial facilities that are critical to restarting the local economy But a spokesperson for Interior told Breitbart News that the agency had nothing to do with the contract or its negotiation Neither the Secretary nor anyone in his office have taken any meetings or action on behalf of this company,  the spokesperson said The Zinkes and the Techmanskis  owners of Whitefish Energy  know each other because they both live in a small town  population 6,000  where everyone knows everyone and his son joined a friend who worked a summer job at one of their construction sites,  the spokesperson said Whitefish Energy announced the contract last week Working side by side with the engineering team of PREPA  the state utility , Whitefish Energy has already repaired several miles of key transmission and distribution lines, bringing the team within days of energizing and restoring power to multiple Puerto Rico towns and communities Consistent with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell ’s plan, Whitefish Energy is committed to restoring power to 100 percent of the island, and ensuring Puerto Rico has an improved, resilient electrical grid The Post claimed the decision by Puerto Rico state officials  is drawing scrutiny from Congress  and the media outlet sought skeptics of the deal for its report The fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out, it is at least odd why  the utility  would go to Whitefish,  Susan F  Tierney, a former senior official at the Energy Department and state regulatory agencies, said   I’m scratching my head wondering how it all adds up But Chris Chiames, spokesman for Whitefish Energy, said the company is committed to the work despite the risks We are taking personal risks and business risks working in perilous physical and financial conditions,  Chiames told the Post   So the carping by others is unfounded, and we stand by our work and our commitment to the people of Puerto Rico Andy Techmanski, chief executive of Whitefish Energy, told CNN that the contract resulted from conversations between his company and utility officials in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has 2,400 miles of transmission lines across the island, and 30,000 miles of distribution lines with some 300 substations, the Post reported The House Committee on Natural Resources is examining Whitefish Energy’s role in Puerto Rico, Parish Braden, a spokesman for the committee, told the Post The size and unknown details of this contract raises numerous questions,  Braden said   This is one of many things the committee is taking a close look at as it continues to work with the resident commissioner, governor’s office, and oversight board to ensure Puerto Rico’s recovery is robust, effective and sustained "

"It was the ninth time Russia has used its veto power at the Security Council to block action targeting its Syrian ally Russia opposed renewing the mandate of the joint UN Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  OPCW  panel before it releases a report on a sarin gas attack in Khan Sheikhun expected on Thursday Britain, France and the United States have accused President Bashar Assad’s forces of carrying out the April 4 attack on the opposition held village, killing scores of people, including children After Russia cast its veto, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said Moscow was  once again  siding  with the dictators and terrorists who use these weapons Russia has once again demonstrated it will do whatever it takes to ensure the barbaric Assad regime never faces consequences for its continued use of chemicals as weapons,  Haley said in a statement China and Kazakhstan abstained from the vote, Bolivia joined Russia in voting against and 11 other countries backed extending the mandate The panel, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism  JIM , was set up by Russia and the United States in 2015 to identify the perpetrators of chemical attacks in Syria’s six year war Its mandate was renewed last year by the council, which must decide on a further renewal by November 17 Dishonoring RussiaRussia failed at the opening of the meeting to garner enough support for a motion to delay the vote until next month Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the veto did not mean that the investigation was shut down  He added that Moscow would seek to amend the panel’s mandate to ensure it is impartial We did not close the JIM  We simply did not take a decision on extending it today,  he said   We will return to it Britain, France and the United States agreed that another vote could be held in the coming weeks to allow the JIM to continue its work Nebenzia accused the United States and its partners of seeking a vote on the measure  to show up and dishonor Russia What is taking place today is not very pleasant,  said Nebenzia   It stinks, in fact We are seeing a well rehearsed spectacle, which only strives to show up and embarrass one country,  he added In a statement released in Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry insisted that it had the right to study the upcoming report before making an assessment and accused the United States of trying to  impose its position A resolution requires nine votes to be adopted at the council, but five countries   Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States   can block adoption with their veto power Who is to blame for Khan Sheikhun More than 87 people died in the nerve gas attack in Khan Sheikhun that drew global outrage and prompted the United States to fire cruise missiles at a Syrian air base from which the West says the assault was launched Last month, UN war crimes investigators said they had evidence that the Syrian air force was behind the attack, despite repeated denials from Damascus Russia maintains that the sarin attack was most likely caused by a bomb set off directly on the ground, not by a Syrian air strike as alleged by the West While the OPCW has established that sarin was used in the April attack, it does not have a mandate to assign blame, leaving that determination to the JIM The JIM has already concluded that Syrian government forces were responsible for chlorine attacks on three villages in 2014 and 2015, and that the Islamic State group used mustard gas in 2015 The OPCW is reviewing more than 60 cases of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria, including a recently uncovered sarin attack on an opposition held village on March 30 "
"Psychologists call this projection Hillary Clinton’s campaign hired an attorney, Marc Elias, who hired a firm, Fusion GPS, which hired former British intelligence officer and student radical Christopher Steele, who secretly produced the infamous  Russian dossier  defaming Donald Trump The green paper trail actually appears more meandering than that, but, for simplicity’s sake, it works best to keep it super complex rather than super duper complex  Some super sleuths at the Washington Post connected the dots  But the Clinton campaign purposefully kept those dots far enough apart to confuse anyone who looked into it  In fact, the trail looks a lot like money laundering in reverse, clean cash filtered through several ostensibly legitimate outfits before making its way into the dirty hands of a political hatchet man Of course, campaign finance laws guard us against such shenanigans as it turns out, not well  Reading the Federal Election Commission filings of the Clinton campaign, we see that it paid  5 6 million to Elias’s firm Perkins Coie  It does not indicate how that law firm spent that  5 6 million The people who received much of that money, Fusion GPS, look about as keen as the Clinton campaign to fess up to where the money went  Executives cite confidentiality agreements in refusing to say who, precisely, supported hatchet man Steele’s  investigation  They resist a subpoena to turn over financial records to the House Intelligence Committee  When company brass went before that committee, they took the Fifth Amendment One unabashedly secretive group, not heretofore regarded as an auxiliary of the Democratic National Committee, supporting Steele’s work was the Federal Bureau of Investigation After the election, the FBI agreed to pay Steele to continue gathering intelligence about Trump and Russia,  The Washington Post reports,  but the bureau pulled out of the arrangement after Steele was publicly identified in news reports Like the Clinton Campaign, Marc Elias, and Fusion GPS, the FBI wanted to fund Steele’s efforts  They just did not want anyone to know it  The FBI’s involvement evokes When a Stranger Calls   We’ve traced the call  It’s coming from inside the house  When did the bureau’s director begin imagining himself as bag man for partisan muckrakers Remarkably, the smear file created at the behest of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party made its way into a briefing for President Barack Obama and resulted in its author gaining an audience with former FBI Director Robert Mueller in his ongoing investigation of Donald Trump  The media continued to refer to the gossip as a  dossier  and its contents as  intelligence  when it constituted opposition research bankrolled by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee And this appears as the clear reason why the Democrats went to such lengths to distance themselves from their dirt digging expedition  They wanted Americans to greet the information they paid for as information independently gathered, not by bought hacks but by intelligence agents  They wanted Americans to believe their wild charges, and to accomplish this they could not reveal that they produced the  evidence  that supposedly vindicated those charges  And for almost a year, Democrats mostly succeeded in this endeavor It sometimes takes a village to raise a child  It sometimes takes a conspiracy to launch a conspiracy theory "
"Trump’s decision comes after he reduced the annual inflow of refugees from more than 100,000 down to 45,000  Conservative hoped for a deeper reform and a greater focus on aid to refugees in their homelands, but the cut is popular, and it caused an outcry from progressives, the taxpayer funded groups that care for the refugees, and from the meatpacking and dairy industries which employ many of the new and usually unskilled refugees The restart decision comes after three security officials provided their recommendations to Trump The new security provisions include an intensive review of refugees from 11 unnamed nations, according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security  The statement said that officials concluded that additional in depth review is needed with respect to refugees from 11 countries previously identified as posing a higher risk to the United States  Consequently, admissions for applicants from those 11 high risk countries will move forward on a case by case basis during an additional 90 day review period, consistent with our national security interests  As DHS, State and DNI complete individual country reviews, they may resume a standard admissions process for applicants from those countries Officials will also begin security reviews of the chain migrants who are being invited into the United States by approved refugees  The agency recommendations said Based on an assessment of current systems checks, as well as requirements for uniformity identified by Section 5, we will direct our staffs to work jointly to implement adequate screening mechanisms for following to join refugees that are similar to the processes employed for principal refugees, in order to ensure the security and welfare of the United States  We will resume admission of following to join refugees once those enhancements have been implemented In a late afternoon phone call with reporters, officials declined to explain the new security procedures  For example, one official said the checks on immigrants from the 11 countries would be using a totality of the circumstances regarding the applicant’s overall credibility Another official insisted the agencies would not  discriminate  when he was asked to explain what characteristics would cause officials to exclude particular refugees  The official declined to describe what characteristics would cause officials to accept some refugees and to reject others DHS acting chief Elaine Duke offered a similarly vague explanation, saying The security of the American people is this administration’s highest priority, and these improved vetting measures are essential for American security  These new, standardized screening measures provide an opportunity for the United States to welcome those in need into our country, while ensuring a safer, more secure homeland This evasiveness may be forced by the government lawyers who protecting Trump’s policies from progressive judges, several of whom now insist they have the power to admit immigrants and refugees despite opposition from the elected president Agency opposition to Trump’s policies has also been strong  In September, the federal officials who run the nation’s immigration agencies claimed that they are clearing  630 million a year in extra taxes for the federal government by importing the low skill refugees for jobs that would otherwise be done by sidelined Americans or be automated by American built technology That study was slammed by critics for hiding the multi billion dollar costs of recent immigrants, many of whom are uneducated, unskilled and unlikely to assimilate into the United States’s culture "
"The Free Beacon reports that, in discussing the proceeds from a major 2013 settlement with Bank of America and Citigroup, Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Elizabeth Taylor and Associate Attorney General Tony West exchanged a series of emails  Among other things, they emphasize the importance of  not allowing Citi to pick a statewide intermediary like the Pacific Legal Foundation  because that group  does conservative property rights free legal services Much of the DOJ settlement money from these suits went instead to avowedly left wing groups like the National Urban League and National Council of La Raza, now known as UnidosUS  According to the Free Beacon, an activist from one of the groups due to receive Bank of America and Citigroup cash under the scheme wrote in an email,  I would be willing to build a statue  of West  and then we could bow down to this statue each day after we get out  200,000 Cy pres  payments   where mostly corporate defendants agree to pay into charities as part of their settlement with the government to avoid further prosecution   have been a regular feature of DOJ civil lawsuits since the 1970 s, when the Community Reinvestment Act began the practice of requiring banks and financial institutions to fund  community organizations  Under President Barack Obama’s attorney generals, however, the practice rapidly expanded, flush with cash from massive settlements from banks stemming from the 2008 financial crisis The practice began to attract negative attention towards the end of Obama’s term in office  In 2015, Kimberly Strassel called the program  a scheme to undermine Congress’s spending authority by independently transferring dollars to President Obama’s political allies  in her Wall Street Journal op ed  Shortly thereafter, Republicans in Congress tried unsuccessfully to rein in the Department of Justice, before trying again this year Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to all sections of the DOJ in June categorically stopping the practice  As Breitbart News discovered, Sessions’ office then initiated a department wide review of all cy pres settlements for the past decade that would not meet his newly specified standards "

"Ryan, during a talk before the Republican Study Committee  RSC , reportedly said an amnesty for illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the Obama created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  would be included in an end of the year spending deal He did talk about the fact that that would be good if we could get ahead of that as opposed to being reactionary,  RSC Chairman Mark Walker  R NC  told the Huffington Post following the meeting with Ryan Another two House Republicans confirmed to the Huffington Post that Ryan mentioned slipping DACA amnesty into the spending deal at the gathering While Walker said Ryan  did talk about border security,  it was not in the context of making sure a border wall   which President Trump has promised to construct along the U S Mexico border   would be part of any spending bill I don’t think that anybody has said definitively that the wall has to be part of that,  Walker said Immediately, Rep Ted Yoho  R FL  and Rep  Raul Labrador  R ID  slammed Ryan’s alleged comments to the Huffington Post about giving DACA illegal aliens amnesty in the spending bill He better not,  Yoho said Labrador mocked Ryan’s DACA move, saying  That’s true leadership, I guess  and called the initiative a  big problem The Republican establishment has been pushing amnesty for DACA illegal aliens   and subsequently, the other 12 to 30 million illegal aliens residing in the U S    since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on behalf of the Trump administration that DACA would officially be ended in March 2018 Last month, Trump seemed to cave on DACA, demanding Congress pass a  quick  amnesty for illegal aliens covered by the program, going against years of campaign promises that he would stand against amnesty deals, as Breitbart News reported An amnesty for DACA illegal aliens has the potential to lead to a chain migration of upwards of six million more foreign nationals coming to the U S  over the course of the next few years For instance, as Breitbart News reported, latest data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  shows that 618,342 illegal aliens from Mexico currently have DACA status  If they were amnestied into the U S , it would give them the opportunity to bring adult parents and relatives to the U S According to Princeton University researchers Stacie Carr and Marta Tienda, for every one new Mexican immigrant to the U S , an additional 6 38 Mexican nationals come to the U S  through family chain migration Based on the Princeton research, the 618, 342 illegal aliens from Mexico who are covered by DACA would be able to bring upwards of four million additional relatives and family members to the U S  in the years to come If the remaining estimated 180,000 DACA recipients brought in three family members each after being amnestied, it would result in additional 540,000 immigrants  Should the remaining 180,000 DACA recipients bring four family members each to the U S , it would result in more than 700,000 new immigrants But if the remaining roughly 180,000 DACA recipients were to bring the same number of family members as Mexican DACA recipients are expected to bring to the U S , it would result in nearly 1 2 million more legal family based immigrants coming to the country Although screening for DACA was previously touted as being sufficient in keeping criminals out, USCIS revealed that more than 2,100 recipients had their status revoked for being criminals or gang members John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News  Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder "

"McDaniel, who is likely to run against Wicker, is calling Wicker out for not going far enough in denouncing establishment Republicans in the U S  Senate who are not just standing in the way of President Donald Trump’s agenda but are now personally insulting the president Wicker criticized Sen  Bob Corker  R TN  for attacking Trump on Tuesday, which Wicker did both on CNN and in an exclusive in which he doubled down on criticizing Corker to Breitbart News in an exclusive follow up But, as Breitbart News noted earlier, Wicker refused to answer two specific questions regarding McConnell’s role in Corker’s anti Trump obstinance  First, Wicker refused to answer whether he believes McConnell is doing enough to rein in Corker who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his battle with President Trump  Second, Wicker refused to answer whether he supports a convening of the Senate GOP conference to vote on removing Corker as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Corker’s and Trump’s feud escalated again Tuesday morning with the president and senator firing off a bunch of tweets at each other Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal   couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump  Look at his record  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Isn't it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn't get re elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Sen  Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee,   look how poorly the U S  has done  He doesn't have a clue as  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us  People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U S  way back  Now we move forward  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president  #AlertTheDaycareStaff  Senator Bob Corker  @SenBobCorker  October 24, 2017 Now comes McDaniel with his response to what he believes is Wicker’s weak kneed defense of the president, in his own exclusive with Breitbart News  McDaniel was not surprised that Wicker is standing in the way of President Trump and his agenda and said if he really backed Trump he would stop backing McConnell and would support changing U S  Senate rules to drop a 60 vote requirement to pass legislation  Right now, the so called filibuster rule in the U S  Senate requires 60 votes to pass legislation and since Republicans only have a 52 seat majority the rule empowers a small sliver of eight Democrats who are in the minority to block any and all legislation Wicker is just playing political games by trying to hide his role as a member of Mitch McConnell’s leadership team, as a McConnell  yes’ man,  McDaniel told Breitbart News when asked to respond to Wicker’s lackadaisical defense of the president   If Wicker truly cared about the Trump agenda, then he would not obstruct President Trump by refusing to change the senate rules and eliminate the 60 vote filibuster requirement  He would also stop blindly supporting McConnell  But I’m not surprised by Wicker’s current charade  He’s facing the possibility of a serious primary challenge  It’s what the swamp creatures do when threatened   morph into political chameleons McDaniel is likely to step up and challenge Wicker for the U S  Senate, after he came just shy of defeating Sen  Thad Cochran  R MS  back in 2014  In fact, among Republicans, McDaniel won the 2014 GOP primary runoff but Cochran only won because his political consultants engaged in chicanery to get Democrats to vote for Cochran in the runoff  McDaniel got more votes than Cochran overall in the first round of the primary, but because he was shy of 50 percent it was kicked to the runoff three weeks later  Many Mississippi voters still to this day believe, as the New York Times’ Jeremy Peters wrote from the state in a recent report, that the seat was stolen from McDaniel  Now, in 2017, Cochran has serious health problems that are raising per multiple media reports serious questions about whether he can actually continue the job as U S  Senator and may end up resigning or retiring sooner rather than later do to incapability If Cochran resigns or retires, an appointment will be selected shortly thereafter by Mississippi Gov  Phil Bryant and then a special election will follow soon after  It is a strong possibility that Bryant would appoint McDaniel into the seat, given the fact that many from Mississippi believe he rightly won the election in 2014 and that it might be able to stave off a looming McDaniel challenge of Wicker  Other names that come up on the short list from Mississippi, per sources with knowledge of these discussions, include Bryant appointing himself or Bryant appointing state Sen  Michael Watson  Watson and Bryant are both fellow conservatives like McDaniel, and would likely easily win re election in the special election after the appointment  If Bryant appoints swamp backed establishment figures like Rep  Gregg Harper  R MS  or Lt  Gov  Tate Reeves or anyone else like them it is likely to set up another scenario like what just happened in neighboring Alabama where conservative Judge Roy Moore defeated appointed incumbent Sen  Luther Strange in a primary runoff Nonetheless, the staunchly pro Trump McDaniel is expected for now to run against Wicker With a Conservative Review score of 30 and a Heritage Action score of 52, he  Wicker  has a failing conservative record, so he needs to try to ride the president’s coattails,  McDaniel told Breitbart News   But it’s not going to work this time  Our eyes are open  President Trump promised us he would drain the swamp  And one way or the other, I intend to help him keep his promise Interestingly, in 2014, Trump endorsed McDaniel over Cochran in that primary  Trump has reportedly, however, called Wicker to tell him he would support him in a primary something Trump has not yet said publicly I hope voters in Mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel  He is strong, he is smart   he wants things to change in Washington  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  June 24, 2014 It remains to be seen what Trump would do in this scenario, but he did try to help Strange in Alabama’s primary a move that backfired, and one that seemed predicated on bad advice from none other than Corker among others "
"Lt  Rapone’s current twitter account appears under the name,  Punkproletarian,  which he used in September 2017 to tweet a  Veterans for Kaepernick  message, thereby applauding the NFL player’s disrespect for the National Anthem and the United States flag Hey  Just the kind of guy we want defending American sovereignty, American national interests, and leading American soldiers into battle, right Well, brace yourself for the really bad news  West Point faculty and administrators knew about his anti American views and still allowed him to graduate and receive his military commission  Evidently, it is now permissible to hate your country and hope communism triumphs worldwide and still be an officer in the United States Army  So, it is fair to ask, what happened to the West Point values immortalized by General Douglas MacArthur in his iconic 1962 farewell address to West Point cadets,  Duty, Honor, Country Some West Point faculty actually tried to alert the West Point Superintendent to Rapone’s unsuitability for military leadership  A member of the faculty from 2013 2017, Lt  Col  Robert M  Heffington, has published an open letter to describe in great detail the decay of West Point’s standards   the standards are there but rarely enforced   and why Rapone’s success at West Point is a painful symptom of widespread apathy and corruption  Colonel Heffington tried to alert the West Point powers that be to Rapone’s radical views, but his alarms were ignored  You can read his lengthy indictment here Current West Point Superintendent Lt  Gen  Robert  L  Caslen, Jr , has responded to the scandal by promising a full investigation, while Sen  Marco Rubio has called Rapone a  national security threat  and asked the Secretary of the Army to cancel his military commission West Point Superintendent Gen  Caslen assured the public,  Rapone’s actions in no way represent the values of the US Military Academy or the US Army  Well, if true, that is indeed reassuring, but it does not answer the more pressing question   how did this communist crusader pass through West Point successfully  Meanwhile, Lt  Rapone continues to wear the uniform and collect the paycheck of a US Army Second Lieutenant while serving as a volunteer community organizer for Democratic Socialists of America  DSA No doubt, Barack Obama is proud that under his presidency, West Point began producing community organizers along with military leaders, but probably the U S  Congress and Defense Secretary Mattis will want to take a closer look at West Point’s apparent surrender to political correctness Undoubtedly, in the coming weeks, we will see a lot of back peddling and a hundred excuses offered for the emergence of the  commie cadet  In fact, the American left and liberal news media are already busy shifting the spotlight away from Marxist Lt  Spenser Rampone and onto the patriots criticizing the breakdown of West Point standards  A recent Newsweek story on Lt  Rapone screamed this headline   Now conservatives want him dead   In the story, readers were told,  The West Point statement helps to sum up just how polarized and surreal online politics have become in the age of President Donald Trump  Newsweek readers are being asked to believe that an Army officer tweeting  F k this country  and  Communism will win  is not the problem  the problem is excessive public outrage  in the age of Trump So, to the liberal media, again, it is Trump’s fault  The handsome young Army officer is being persecuted for his progressive beliefs  Really, we can’t make this stuff up When you stop to think it through, maybe it should not be so surprising that our premier military academy has permitted an avowed, crusading communist to enter the ranks of our Army officer corps  With so many of our most prestigious universities proudly graduating hundreds and even thousands of Marxists and social justice warriors every year  without much criticism or concern expressed by trustees, regents or legislators   why should we expect our military academies to somehow remain aloof and immune from that academic affliction Obviously, many questions about Comrade Rapone remain unanswered  He enlisted in the US Army out of high school and served one tour in Afghanistan prior to applying to West Point, so perhaps fighting the Taliban butchers was permitted by his progressive values  But according to all available descriptions of the West Point admission standards, besides exceptional academic prowess and high physical fitness standards, applicants must possess  demonstrated leadership potential It will be interesting to hear West Point’s explanation of how Comrade Rapone measured up to all academic and moral standards  If the answer turns out to be that he met all West Point standards and his military commission will not be canceled, then like our other elite universities, West Point   and perhaps the Pentagon itself   needs a thorough house cleaning "

"Ryan, during a talk before the Republican Study Committee  RSC , reportedly said an amnesty for illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the Obama created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  would be included in an end of the year spending deal He did talk about the fact that that would be good if we could get ahead of that as opposed to being reactionary,  RSC Chairman Mark Walker  R NC  told the Huffington Post following the meeting with Ryan Another two House Republicans confirmed to the Huffington Post that Ryan mentioned slipping DACA amnesty into the spending deal at the gathering While Walker said Ryan  did talk about border security,  it was not in the context of making sure a border wall   which President Trump has promised to construct along the U S Mexico border   would be part of any spending bill I don’t think that anybody has said definitively that the wall has to be part of that,  Walker said Immediately, Rep Ted Yoho  R FL  and Rep  Raul Labrador  R ID  slammed Ryan’s alleged comments to the Huffington Post about giving DACA illegal aliens amnesty in the spending bill He better not,  Yoho said Labrador mocked Ryan’s DACA move, saying  That’s true leadership, I guess  and called the initiative a  big problem The Republican establishment has been pushing amnesty for DACA illegal aliens   and subsequently, the other 12 to 30 million illegal aliens residing in the U S    since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on behalf of the Trump administration that DACA would officially be ended in March 2018 Last month, Trump seemed to cave on DACA, demanding Congress pass a  quick  amnesty for illegal aliens covered by the program, going against years of campaign promises that he would stand against amnesty deals, as Breitbart News reported An amnesty for DACA illegal aliens has the potential to lead to a chain migration of upwards of six million more foreign nationals coming to the U S  over the course of the next few years For instance, as Breitbart News reported, latest data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  shows that 618,342 illegal aliens from Mexico currently have DACA status  If they were amnestied into the U S , it would give them the opportunity to bring adult parents and relatives to the U S According to Princeton University researchers Stacie Carr and Marta Tienda, for every one new Mexican immigrant to the U S , an additional 6 38 Mexican nationals come to the U S  through family chain migration Based on the Princeton research, the 618, 342 illegal aliens from Mexico who are covered by DACA would be able to bring upwards of four million additional relatives and family members to the U S  in the years to come If the remaining estimated 180,000 DACA recipients brought in three family members each after being amnestied, it would result in additional 540,000 immigrants  Should the remaining 180,000 DACA recipients bring four family members each to the U S , it would result in more than 700,000 new immigrants But if the remaining roughly 180,000 DACA recipients were to bring the same number of family members as Mexican DACA recipients are expected to bring to the U S , it would result in nearly 1 2 million more legal family based immigrants coming to the country Although screening for DACA was previously touted as being sufficient in keeping criminals out, USCIS revealed that more than 2,100 recipients had their status revoked for being criminals or gang members John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News  Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder "
"Flake’s announcement comes as he continues to push amnesty for illegal aliens and cheap, foreign labor programs, all while opposing Sen  Tom Cotton  R AR  and Sen  David Perdue’s  R GA  pro American RAISE Act, which would help raise wages for U S  workers by cutting legal immigration levels in half With Flake’s upcoming departure from the U S  Senate, his allies in the open borders and cheap foreign labor lobby are eulogizing his political career, in which he failed to pass an unpopular amnesty plan for illegal aliens as a member of the  Gang of Eight  group of Senators Pro immigration advocates at the National Immigration Forum were saddened by Flake’s announcement, saying the Senate would be losing a  guiding star  on their open borders agenda  The group’s executive director, Ali Noorani said On behalf of the National Immigration Forum, I want to thank Senator Flake for his service to the nation  While he will continue to lead and be our champion on issues of immigrants and immigration in the months to come, the U S  Senate is losing one of its guiding stars on these issues  From his thoughtful engagement on broad immigration reform to his steadfast support of refugees to his compassionate outreach to Arizona’s Muslim community, few public servants have served America so well Similarly, analyst David Bier with the Charles and David Koch linked CATO Institute   which regularly pushes a mass immigration and free trade agenda   called Flake the most  honest member  of the Senate in response to the news Senate loses most honest member  Flake announces retirement as he rebukes Trump "
"McDaniel, who is likely to run against Wicker, is calling Wicker out for not going far enough in denouncing establishment Republicans in the U S  Senate who are not just standing in the way of President Donald Trump’s agenda but are now personally insulting the president Wicker criticized Sen  Bob Corker  R TN  for attacking Trump on Tuesday, which Wicker did both on CNN and in an exclusive in which he doubled down on criticizing Corker to Breitbart News in an exclusive follow up But, as Breitbart News noted earlier, Wicker refused to answer two specific questions regarding McConnell’s role in Corker’s anti Trump obstinance  First, Wicker refused to answer whether he believes McConnell is doing enough to rein in Corker who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his battle with President Trump  Second, Wicker refused to answer whether he supports a convening of the Senate GOP conference to vote on removing Corker as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Corker’s and Trump’s feud escalated again Tuesday morning with the president and senator firing off a bunch of tweets at each other Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal   couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump  Look at his record  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Isn't it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn't get re elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Sen  Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee,   look how poorly the U S  has done  He doesn't have a clue as  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 the entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us  People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U S  way back  Now we move forward  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  October 24, 2017 Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president  #AlertTheDaycareStaff  Senator Bob Corker  @SenBobCorker  October 24, 2017 Now comes McDaniel with his response to what he believes is Wicker’s weak kneed defense of the president, in his own exclusive with Breitbart News  McDaniel was not surprised that Wicker is standing in the way of President Trump and his agenda and said if he really backed Trump he would stop backing McConnell and would support changing U S  Senate rules to drop a 60 vote requirement to pass legislation  Right now, the so called filibuster rule in the U S  Senate requires 60 votes to pass legislation and since Republicans only have a 52 seat majority the rule empowers a small sliver of eight Democrats who are in the minority to block any and all legislation Wicker is just playing political games by trying to hide his role as a member of Mitch McConnell’s leadership team, as a McConnell  yes’ man,  McDaniel told Breitbart News when asked to respond to Wicker’s lackadaisical defense of the president   If Wicker truly cared about the Trump agenda, then he would not obstruct President Trump by refusing to change the senate rules and eliminate the 60 vote filibuster requirement  He would also stop blindly supporting McConnell  But I’m not surprised by Wicker’s current charade  He’s facing the possibility of a serious primary challenge  It’s what the swamp creatures do when threatened   morph into political chameleons McDaniel is likely to step up and challenge Wicker for the U S  Senate, after he came just shy of defeating Sen  Thad Cochran  R MS  back in 2014  In fact, among Republicans, McDaniel won the 2014 GOP primary runoff but Cochran only won because his political consultants engaged in chicanery to get Democrats to vote for Cochran in the runoff  McDaniel got more votes than Cochran overall in the first round of the primary, but because he was shy of 50 percent it was kicked to the runoff three weeks later  Many Mississippi voters still to this day believe, as the New York Times’ Jeremy Peters wrote from the state in a recent report, that the seat was stolen from McDaniel  Now, in 2017, Cochran has serious health problems that are raising per multiple media reports serious questions about whether he can actually continue the job as U S  Senator and may end up resigning or retiring sooner rather than later do to incapability If Cochran resigns or retires, an appointment will be selected shortly thereafter by Mississippi Gov  Phil Bryant and then a special election will follow soon after  It is a strong possibility that Bryant would appoint McDaniel into the seat, given the fact that many from Mississippi believe he rightly won the election in 2014 and that it might be able to stave off a looming McDaniel challenge of Wicker  Other names that come up on the short list from Mississippi, per sources with knowledge of these discussions, include Bryant appointing himself or Bryant appointing state Sen  Michael Watson  Watson and Bryant are both fellow conservatives like McDaniel, and would likely easily win re election in the special election after the appointment  If Bryant appoints swamp backed establishment figures like Rep  Gregg Harper  R MS  or Lt  Gov  Tate Reeves or anyone else like them it is likely to set up another scenario like what just happened in neighboring Alabama where conservative Judge Roy Moore defeated appointed incumbent Sen  Luther Strange in a primary runoff Nonetheless, the staunchly pro Trump McDaniel is expected for now to run against Wicker With a Conservative Review score of 30 and a Heritage Action score of 52, he  Wicker  has a failing conservative record, so he needs to try to ride the president’s coattails,  McDaniel told Breitbart News   But it’s not going to work this time  Our eyes are open  President Trump promised us he would drain the swamp  And one way or the other, I intend to help him keep his promise Interestingly, in 2014, Trump endorsed McDaniel over Cochran in that primary  Trump has reportedly, however, called Wicker to tell him he would support him in a primary something Trump has not yet said publicly I hope voters in Mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel  He is strong, he is smart   he wants things to change in Washington  Donald J  Trump  @realDonaldTrump  June 24, 2014 It remains to be seen what Trump would do in this scenario, but he did try to help Strange in Alabama’s primary a move that backfired, and one that seemed predicated on bad advice from none other than Corker among others "

"1 Flake’s Gang of Eight AmnestyIn 2013, Flake was one of four GOP Senators who allied with Democrats to push the cheap labor and amnesty comprehensive immigration reform bill  The 2013 bill gutted the 1986 law, effectively making it legal for employers to hire illegals, until media coverage forced the  Gang of Eight  to restore the 1986 provision, as Breitbart News reported  Flake’s bill died in 2014, and it was so unpopular it helped the Democrats lose 10 Senate seats in the 2014 election 2 Jeff Flake   There Must Always’ Be Low Skilled Immigration to U S There must always  be a flow low skilled immigration to the United States, no matter its impact on American workers, according to Republican establishment figure Senator Jeff Flake, Breitbart News reported 3 Jeff Flake  GOP Should Embrace Pro Amnesty  Autopsy’ ReportSen  Jeff Flake  R AZ  wants Republicans to embrace the foolish Republican National Committee’s  RNC   autopsy  report, which was released after Mitt Romney’s 2012 loss and recommended amnesty for illegal immigrants as its only policy solution, Breitbart News reported 4 Jeff Flake   I’ll Take the Globalist Moniker, Thank You’ Seemingly overnight, the word globalist became a grave insult among people in my party who also call themselves  conservative,’  he reportedly writes in his new book, according to the Arizona Republic    In this country, we are less than 5 percent of the world’s population  We are 20 percent of the world’s economic output  And if we don’t trade, we don’t grow  Given the alternatives, I’ll take the globalist moniker, thank you,  Breitbart News reported 5 Jeff Flake Obstructing Border Patrol to Protect His Family’s Illegal Alien Farm WorkersBefore going to college,  my life was made far more difficult during the middle of summer when the Border Patrol would raid our farm,  Flake wrote in his new autobiography, titled Conscience of a Conservative,  which slams President Donald Trump, as Breitbart News reported  Flake continued Sometimes the Border Patrol would send small planes to search our alfalfa fields for migrants  When I would hear the distinctive whine of the Cessna  search aircraft , I’d hop on a horse, put on a hat that would obscure my head, and try to divert the Border Patrol away from our workers   a decoy in the game of cat and mouse 6  Jeff Flake   You Can’t Cut Immigration’Despite legal immigration and illegal immigration being a burden on American workers’ wages and jobs, Flake has continuingly denounced any cuts to legal immigration, where the U S  admits more than one million foreign nationals a year You can’t cut immigration, legal immigration, in half,  Flake told NBC’s  Meet the Press  August 6, as Breitbart News reported 7  Jeff Flake   We Know Very Well The Value of Migrant Labor’ While I agree we ought to move in the direction of some other countries like Australia and Canada in terms of merit based visas, the overall number cut   I think this would cut it to about half of our legal immigration   just isn’t the right direction for the economy,  Flake told CNN, adding that employers still want to hire cheap, unskilled foreign workers, Breitbart News reported  He said We know very well   in Arizona, in particular   the value of migrant labor  I grew up on a ranch in Snowflake, Arizona  I grew up working next to migrant labor  I always felt they were making America better, and we are better off because of their hard work 8  Jeff Flake Pretends DACA Illegal Aliens Are ChildrenAs Pew Research Center analyzed, the average age of DACA recipients is 24 years old, far from the young age that Democrat and Republican establishment politicians like Sen  Jeff Flake  R AZ have made the group of illegal aliens out to be, as Breitbart News reported 9  Jeff Flake Supports Loophole Giving Illegal Aliens Immediate Welfare Access Sen  Jeff Flake  R AZ  backed down from a previous promise his spokeswoman made to Breitbart News that he would consider voting in favor of amendments to the Senate’s immigration bill that would close a loophole allowing illegal immigrants immediate access to state and local welfare 10  Jeff Flake  DACA Illegal Aliens  Should Not Be Punished’ There are 800,000 DACA kids, kids who were brought across the border, the median age I think is six years old for those 800,000 when they came across the border, they should not be punished for the sins of their parents,  Flake told CNN, as Breitbart News reported   That’s the basic principle we ought to follow  They are in school, some graduated and worked almost all of them, some 90 percent of them are in the work force  To remove them from the country, to split up families like this is just not the way we ought to go 11  Jeff Flake  Suck It Up And Pass TPPFlake acknowledged that globalist trade policies are currently unpopular because many American workers have been devastated by the negative impact of these trade deals  Flake says that it’s been challenging for politicians to get voters to ignore these losses and instead focus on how these trade deals have benefited companies, which have reaped the rewards of cheaper goods, as Breitbart News reported 12  Flake’s Strong Opposition to Pro American RAISE Act Senators Tom Cotton  R AR  and David Perdue  R GA  introduced the specific plan, known as the  RAISE Act  President Donald Trump endorsed the plan and said the legislation  will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars,  among other things, as Breitbart News reported Flake derided the plan, saying the current legal immigration system, where the U S  admits more than one million low skilled legal immigrants a year, must continue When President Trump embraced a proposal this month that would cut legal immigration by 50 percent, I spoke out against it, thinking of the immigrant workers I grew up with  When re evaluating immigration policy, it is right to give priority, through a point system or otherwise, to those who have skills and abilities unique to the new economy  We did this in 2013, in the bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate  But there must always be a place in America for those whose only initial credentials are a strong back and an eagerness to use it 13  Jeff Flake’s Gang of Eight Amnesty Would Have  Hollowed Out the Middle Class,  Sessions SaysThe  Gang of Eight  pro immigration legislation Flake referred to in the op ed would have legalized the estimated 12 to 30 million living in the U S  Under the amnesty plan, then Senator Jeff Sessions  R AL said Flake’s amnesty plan would have  hollowed out the middle class  by legalizing millions of illegal aliens, further depressing U S  wages, and making it harder for Americans to find work  A study by the Center for Immigration Studies confirmed Sessions’ sentiment, Breitbart News reported 14  Jeff Flake Opposes Border Wall to Protect Americans Obviously all of us believe in border security,  Flake told CNN, as Breitbart News reported   It depends on what he means by the wall, and we still haven’t seen what he means by the wall  If that’s a metaphor for border security, we can certainly support that  If he’s talking about a solitary brick and mortar 2,000 mile edifice on the border, then no and nobody ought to support that  We haven’t seen what the president is really talking about when he talks about the wall 15  Jeff Flake Eulogizes His Pro Immigration, Pro Free Trade Dogma, Despite It’s Detriment to American WorkersFlake said that he no longer could serve as a conservative in a party that no longer valued free trade or immigration, Breitbart News reported It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative, who believes in limited government and free markets, devoted to free trade, pro immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican party,  Flake said, his voice trembling with emotion John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart

" Washington Post gave us an assist last night,  Drew Messer, a senior adviser to Moore’s campaign, told Breitbart News exclusively   If they think endorsing Doug Jones will influence Alabamians to support his radical left wing agenda, then they don’t understand Alabama  Just like the primary, Alabama will decide this election  Not Washington Messer’s comment to Breitbart News comes after the Post went out of its way to, in an editorial board leftist screed, praise Jones and back him for the U S  Senate instead of Moore  Moore battled Washington, D C , interests throughout the GOP primary and runoff until his historic victory over appointed incumbent Sen  Luther Strange  R AL  on Sept  26, and now appears to be lining up against the swamp again as Washington, D C , seeks to dictate to Alabama who to send to the U S  Senate rather than the other way around Under a headline saying  Roy Moore is unfit to serve,  the Washington Post’s editorial board wholeheartedly endorsed Jones the newspaper wrote ALABAMA VOTERS will pick a new senator in December, and their choice is between one of the most divisive, counterproductive figures in U S  politics and a well qualified, even tempered former prosecutor  In other words, there is no choice  Former judge Roy Moore  R  is unfit to serve  Former prosecutor Doug Jones  D  would be a credit to the state  It is cliche to say that Mr  Moore’s strange rise has been fueled by anti Washington anger  Yet electing Mr  Moore would be a sure way to worsen Washington’s problems  His unapologetic extremism would pour gasoline on the already raging fire of partisanship and dysfunction The paper goes on to bash Moore, before heaping praise on Jones  The Post writes, seeking to sway voters over to the other side from the GOPSome Republicans may be tempted to overlook these shortcomings in deference to Mr  Moore’s party label  In this instance they should evaluate his opponent, Mr  Jones, with an open mind  Mr  Jones has not shied from Democratic policy positions, but he has run a high minded campaign, avoided inflaming voters with divisive social issues and insisted that both sides should cooperate  He is distinguished in character and temperament  A former federal prosecutor, he boasts a record that should appeal to those seeking a leader devoted to the rule of law who will put the country first  Alabamians should reject the radical lawbreaker Mr  Moore and send Mr  Jones, a smart, experienced pragmatist, to Washington Despite the false praise of Jones as a moderate, Messer Moore’s senior adviser noted that Jones is anything but Doug Jones is a liberal trial attorney and a staunch supporter of every liberal policy the Democrats have dreamed up,  Messer told Breitbart News   He’s an unapologetic supporter of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton  He wants to allow abortions up until the moment of birth  He wouldn’t change a thing about Obamacare and refuses to address our national debt  He believes people should protest the flag if they so desire and is embarrassed about being from Alabama On the other hand Moore, Messer noted, is an accomplished conservative Judge Moore is a West Point graduate, Vietnam Veteran, Supreme Court Chief Justice and a Constitutional conservative,  Messer told Breitbart News   He is pro life, pro family, pro tax reform and pro military  He wants to build the wall, secure our borders, protect our gun rights and fight activist judges  He is committed to finally fixing our national debt and doing whatever it takes to bring more jobs to Alabama  Is it really that much of a choice when you view the Judge next to Doug All of this, of course, comes on the heels of Jones being exposed as a hard left Democrat with deep ties to leftist billionaire George Soros and insulting the voters of Alabama by saying he thinks it is an  embarrassment  to be from Alabama  In other words, Jones is backed by the Washington swamp who insult Alabamians while Moore is the anti Washington candidate backed by Alabama  No wonder why Moore is up double digits in two recent polls, both of which show him towering over Jones by 11 points "
"A Republican had contracted first with Fusion GPS, and Clinton and the DNC continued to fund Fusion GPS’s work, the report says According to the Post Mark Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U S  intelligence community  Before that agreement, Fusion GPS’s research into Trump was funded by a still unknown Republican client during the GOP primary The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS’s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day The  Russian dossier,  whose contents Trump has denied and which has been widely discredited, is believed to have led the FBI to investigate the Trump campaign and several Trump associates Until now, Fusion GPS has continued to refuse to cooperate with congressional panels investigating Russian attempts to intervene in the election, and how the Obama administration probed those efforts  Democrats have also protected the company The revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were involved in procuring the salacious accusations against Trump that fed their own later accusations of Russian interference in the election lends credence to those who, like Trump himself, have regarded the Russia accusations as conspiracy theories Last week, Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal observed The Washington narrative is focused on special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe  But the ferocious pushback and unseemly tactics from Democrats suggest they are growing worried  Maybe the real story is that Democrats worked with an opposition research firm that has some alarming ties to Russia and potentially facilitated a disinformation campaign during a presidential election On the heels of revelations that the FBI was investigating Russian attempts to influence Hillary Clinton to approve a controversial uranium deal, Democrats will have more questions to answer about possible collusion with Russia  The FBI, too, will face additional scrutiny from Congress   especially as it agreed to pay Steele after the election for additional research into Trump’s potential Russia ties Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named one of the  most influential  people in news media in 2016  He is the co author of How Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution, is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at @joelpollak "

"The daily White House briefing began minutes after Sen  Jeff Flake of Arizona announced his decision to retire from the Senate rather than seek re election, prompting several reporters to question the direction of the Republican party  The day began with Sen  Bob Corker publicly challenging the president, prompting a Twitter feud with Trump Look, you’ve got an individual in the president, he’s a fighter  We’ve said it many times before,  Sanders said   The people of this country didn’t elect somebody to be weak, they elected somebody to be strong She added that both Flake and Corker had fired off  petty comments  about the president when he was just trying to get important agenda items such as tax reform passed in Congress Sanders reminded reporters that Trump did not allow criticisms to go unanswered When he gets hit, he’s going to hit back,  she said After one reporter asked Sanders if the president felt he was winning, despite public criticism from Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker about his presidency, she replied,  I think he feels like America is winning She specifically addressed Flake’s decision to retire, saying that it was  probably a good move  based on the response from voters in Arizona Sanders stressed that the president continues to have a good working relationship with Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell She told Breitbart News that the president has confidence in McConnell’s ability to hold the Senate majority together He thinks that we’re going to work together with Republican senators, particularly Leader McConnell, to get tax cuts and tax reform done this year,  she replied "
"Per Article II of the Constitution, every federal judge must be nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate  Nine months into the president’s term, a Senate controlled by the president’s party has confirmed only seven nominees out of 56, including one Supreme Court nomination Justice Neil Gorsuch was a unique case  It had been decades since there was a pending vacancy on the Supreme Court when a new president was sworn in, and there was a media frenzy that shined such a spotlight on the affable and mild mannered appeals judge that it inescapably resulted in a speedy confirmation process  Senators get no credit for managing to confirm him, though they do deserve credit for keeping the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia open, and for invoking the nuclear option to ensure Justice Gorsuch’s ascension However, since Justice Gorsuch’s confirmation, the Senate has confirmed only six judges less than one per month of the Trump presidency  At this rate, President Trump will see only a fraction of his 150 plus current and forthcoming nominations confirmed by the end of the current four year term  Supporters of a judiciary that is faithful to the Constitution as written lay all the blame squarely on the Senate, and are pushing McConnell to do several things within his power to rapidly accelerate this process As a recent memo from the Conservative Action Project pointed out, in recent years the Senate has often been working only 2 5 days per work week  This does not even consider days or weeks when the Senate is in recess  Since May 1 weeks after Justice Gorsuch joined the High Court the total number of Monday Friday standard work days where the Senate has been in recess exceeds 31  In other words, more than a full month in recess during what are working days for most Americans The number of vacancies in the federal judiciary is skyrocketing  President Trump inherited 107 open seats when he took office, more than any of the past five presidents except President Clinton  George H W  Bush had 41, Clinton had 117, George W  Bush had 84, and Barack Obama had 55 The initial number has increased rapidly  there are currently some 145 judicial nominees  When you add the number of judges who have explicitly signaled their retirement but not yet stepped off the bench, that number jumps to 166 The roadblocks to judicial appointments have arisen at two levels  the Senate Judiciary Committee  SJC  and the Senate floor  Most of the committee roadblocks have been plowed through, but not so on the floor Chairman Chuck Grassley  R IA  of the SJC has recently taken major action to move nominations forward  Just last week, Grassley held  hearings for five judges on Tuesday, then a full dozen on Thursday, for an impressive total of 17 Groups are urging Grassley to take the one remaining measure within his power, pertaining to blue slips  Home state senators receive a blue piece of paper when someone in their state is nominated for a federal judgeship, asking if the senators support or oppose the nomination While most SJC chairmen do not treat this as a one senator veto power by refusing to return the blue slip, Grassley has  This has blocked the nomination of Justice David Stras of the Minnesota Supreme Court to be a judge on the U S  Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, because Sen  Al Franken  D MN  refuses to return his blue slip Grassley has signaled that he is getting impatient, however, so that final roadblock may move soon  And Grassley’s recent pace at moving nominees through his committee is earning him a lot of goodwill on the issue No so yet with the Senate floor  Senate Democrats are slow walking nominations, including requiring cloture votes on many nominees, then consuming all 30 hours allowed under Senate rules of post cloture debate  But those rules are subject to reinterpretation by a simple majority of 51 senators  There are 52 Republicans in the Senate, plus Vice President Mike Pence to cast tie breaking votes Senate Republican apologists point out that Bush 43 and Trump have both made 56 nominations to date, and that the Senate has confirmed an equal number for both presidents at this point on the calendar That analogy fails, however, because Bush had to deal with a 50 50 tied Senate that shortly thereafter became 51 49 Democrat controlled  Moreover, President Trump has twice the number of vacancies to fill that Bush had, so it is imperative for conservatives and Republicans to confirm the pending nominees to make room for more McConnell is promising to take major action on judges now that the budget has been passed  Voters are watching to see what will happen next Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News  Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski "

"California AG Xavier Becerra was among the signatories According to KPCC, the letter addressed current bills that would affect concealed carry reciprocity and said,  With the worst shooting in American history fresh in our memory, we urge you and your colleagues to reject these ill conceived bills National reciprocity for concealed carry was introduced to Congress on January 3, 2017  Breitbart News reported that the bill was sponsored by Rep  Richard Hudson  R NC  and would make the concealed carry permit from any state valid in the other 49 states  In other words, it would treat a concealed carry permit like a driver’s license  Moreover, residents of the 12 states that require no permit would be able to carry in other states as long as they had government documentation proving their residency in one of those 12 states  Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and West Virginia Concealed carry had nothing to do with the October 1 Vegas attack  In fact, the only connection between mass public shootings and concealed carry is that mass public attackers repeatedly choose attack locations where concealed carry is prohibited the Aurora movie theater, Orlando Pulse nightclub, Virginia Tech University, etc and this certainly does not lend itself to arguments making it harder for law abiding citizens to be armed for self defense Nevertheless, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stands with Xavier Becerra in arguing against concealed carry reciprocity  Schneiderman describes such reciprocity as a  loophole,  saying,  After each tragedy we lament the loopholes in our federal gun laws  It’s vital that we not create another one The loophole Schneiderman, Becerra, and the other AGs are overlooking is the gun free zone loophole  That is the one loophole that nearly every mass public shooting of recent memory has in common  National reciprocity goes a long way toward ending that loophole AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of  Bullets with AWR Hawkins,  a Breitbart News podcast  He is also the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter @AWRHawkins  Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart com "

" The geniuses in the foreign policy elite, what they left on President Trump is essentially the Bay of Pigs in Venezuela, the Cuban Missile Crisis in Korea and the Vietnam War in Afghanistan  All at one time,  he told a room of about 500 President Trump didn’t do this  The  Deplorables’ that voted for President Trump didn’t do this  This is the geniuses of both political parties,  said the former White House chief strategist   Both political parties delivered this upon us  In addition besides what they’ve allowed to occur in the Middle East The day long event on countering violent extremism, hosted by the Hudson Institute, took place under the sweeping ceilings of the Atrium Ballroom at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House For lunch, guests feasted on a fancy salad bar with choices of butter lettuce leaves or mesclun greens, thick pieces of salmon or steak, and toppings such as Greek olives, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella balls and saut ed onions  Dessert was an airy poundcake with whipped cream and a selection of fresh berries The speakers included former cabinet members   former CIA Directors Leon Panetta and David Petraeus, members of Congress, retired generals, and ambassadors, mostly clad in dark suits and ties Bannon, the afternoon keynote speaker, wore a black sports coat over black collared shirts and khaki pants The ballroom’s lights had gone out during an earlier panel, and Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the U S  and director at the Hudson Institute, joked when introducing Bannon that depending on one’s political views, it either represented either  the forces of darkness up here,  or that the spotlights now directed at the stage represented  illumination The audience sat in rapt silence as Bannon gave a forceful defense of President Trump’s  America First  foreign policy, and why voters chose him instead of Hillary Clinton, whose strength was perceived to be foreign policy President Trump and his whole candidacy from the very beginning   was a repudiation of the elites, the repudiation of the foreign policy establishment, a repudiation of the  Party of Davos ’ A repudiation of this concept we’ve had of this rules based international order   of which the American working class and middle class underwrite with their taxes, and more importantly, with the blood of their children,  he said He noted that the Afghanistan War   began 16 years ago   is now the U S ’s longest sustained military conflict, with no end in sight The working class and the middle class of this country are looking at the taxes we pay, they’re looking at the trillions of dollars that have been spent, they’re looking at the veterans that come home that have PTSD, that are horribly wounded, they’re looking at Section 60 at the National Arlington Cemetery, the young men and women that have died that we’ve buried over there, and I think they’ve looked at the trillions of dollars and I think that it was a rejection,’ he said Bannon noted that he himself had some skin in the game, as a Navy veteran whose own daughter is a West Point graduate, an Iraq veteran and an Army captain And so with President Trump, it was let’s try to bring these wars to some sort of culmination,  he said But, he said,  America First  does not mean  isolationism  by any means Rather, he said, it means defending America’s self interest and working with allies to the extent that it’s in their self interest as well   but not taking on a fight for them For example, he pointed to the fight against radical Islamic terrorism and Trump’s hosting of a summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in May, to discuss with allies three major challenges in the Middle East   the financing and support for terrorist groups, the engagement of Islam with modernity, and stopping Iran’s aggressive expansion in the region Just weeks after the summit, Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia demanded that Qatar stop its support and financing of terrorism  spearheading the fight by themselves Allies understand that we are there for them, but it’s not our fight  It’s your fight  If you’re going to reform Islam and bring it into modernity, that’s a huge civilizational and cultural aspect, and it’s yours,  he said We are prepared to be allies  What I don’t want is these countries to be protectorates,  he added   We’re there to be a partner if needed  We don’t look at it as a multigenerational that we’re going to have combat troops He also said there has been  tremendous engagement  with countries from Japan, to South Korea, to the UAE, to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain This whole thing of  America First’ being isolationist, or it’s  us against the world,’ is, I just think it’s total nonsense  He looks at the world in a different way  It’s very    academic  Walter Russell Mead would say Jacksonian,  he said What’s in the vital national security interest of the United States is what you should commit to  And in those areas of the world where it’s in the vital national security interest of the United States, you will have partners that will be in their national security interests also and you work with us,  he added Along those lines, he said he opposed the current strategy in Afghanistan because he believes it is trying to impose a liberal democratic system on a society that  clearly doesn’t seem to want it We’re not looking to transform the world into our values  I think the world has got to come to its own conclusion how it wants to govern themselves  We have to build the nation called the United States of America,  he said Bannon said he trusted the  common sense and decency and judgment  of the  common man,  more than he did members of the elite, recalling a recent rally in Alabama, where he campaigned for Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore I would take the first 100 people who came to the rally to govern the country than the top 100 partners at Goldman Sachs,  he said The reaction from one attendee was positive I liked the way he handled the questions  He came across as a very reasonable guy, regardless of whatever you think about what he was saying,  said Michael Pregent, an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute   It was the first time I’d seen him in person, so, it was good At one point during Bannon’s speech, a woman could be heard murmuring  Amen  At another point, someone burst out in applause but quickly quieted down A senior fellow at a prominent Washington think tank was reluctant to voice his opinions on the record, only saying he would have to  go away and think  about Bannon’s remarks, and that he could tell that the Breitbart News executive chairman was still  extraordinarily close  to the president He also admitted that even though he was interested in the other speakers, he only physically came to the event to see Bannon It was an opportunity to see Bannon in the flesh,  he said "
"But now they fear their worst nightmares are about to come true, with Justice Neil Gorsuch joining the panel to rule on Janus v  AFSCME, an Illinois case that involves the same fight over free speech rights and collective bargaining In Friedrichs v  California Teachers Association  2016 , the court deadlocked over the question of whether a teacher who disagreed with the political views expressed by her union could still be forced to pay dues to that union  The union countered that members are already allowed to opt out of dues that are used for explicitly political purposes  But the plaintiffs contended that ostensibly non political spending was being spent on political causes In 2016, the Court was expected to rule 5 4 to overturn the precedent set by Abood v  Detroit Board of Education  1977 , which  held that such compelled political speech does not violate the free speech rights of Americans who work in such jobs,  Breitbart News’ Ken Klukowski wrote at the time  But Scalia’s death changed that   reminding all of  what is at stake in the 2016 presidential election,  since the next president would be able to fill his post Now, with Gorsuch on the bench, advocates for education reform are hopeful   as are conservatives, who are the frequent targets of teacher unions in their political campaigns  Unions, by contrast, are deeply distraught  The Sacramento Bee reports California labor leaders sound almost apocalyptic when they describe a looming Supreme Court case that many of them concede likely will cost them members and money Everything is at stake,  says Yvonne Walker, president of Service Employees International Local 1000, state government’s largest union It’s a blatant political attack,  says Eric Heins, the leader of the massive California Teachers Association That’s a way that the corporations are trying to take our legs out from under us,  says Kim Cowart, a state registered nurse and SEIU union leader Meanwhile, the Bee notes, unions are lobbying for new state laws to help them keep their members under control On the other side of the argument, reformers hope that breaking the power of the teachers’ unions to compel dues would also open the door to pension reform, which the unions have long resisted Joel B  Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News  He was named one of the  most influential  people in news media in 2016  He is the co author of How Trump Won  The Inside Story of a Revolution, is available from Regnery  Follow him on Twitter at @joelpollak "
"Since then, that figure has risen to 400 scientific papers Can you imagine the misery and consternation and horror this is going to cause in the corrupt, rancid, rent seeking world of the Climate Industrial Complex I can  It will look something like this Just to be clear, so the greenies can’t bleat about being misrepresented, here is what these various papers say Modern temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events are neither unusual nor unprecedented   Many regions of the Earth are cooler now than they have been for most of the last 10,000 years Natural factors such as the Sun  106 papers , multi decadal oceanic atmospheric oscillations such as the NAO, AMO PDO, ENSO  37 papers , decadal scale cloud cover variations, and internal variability in general have exerted a significant influence on weather and climate changes during both the past and present   Detecting a clear anthropogenic forcing signal amidst the noise of unforced natural variability may therefore be difficult And current emissions mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often costly, ineffective, and perhaps even harmful to the environment   On the other hand, elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere  i e , a greener planet and enhanced crop yields In other words, nobody is denying that climate changes, nobody is denying that the planet has warmed by 0 8 degrees C in the last 150 years, while only a handful deny that carbon dioxide  and other greenhouse gases  has the power to influence temperatures What they are saying in their different ways is that  global warming    as in the big scare story that the planet is heating up at a catastrophic unprecedented rate because of man made CO2 emissions   is bunk  or that the methods being used to combat the problem are bunk Here   courtesy of Kenneth Richard, who has waded through them all   are some examples of what they say It’s the sun, stupid   106 papers

fluctuations by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamical circulationYndestad and Solheim, 2017 Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods  Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods Tejedor et al , 2017 The main driver of the large scale character of the warm and cold episodes may be changes in the solar activity Climate influenced by natural oscillation  eg El Nino  La Nina Belohpetsky et al , 2017 It is well known that most short term global temperature

"Gingrich said he has lobbied for the Iranian resistance movement in the U S  and the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran  PMOI MEK  since he was the top Republican in the House Gingrich said Because basically the Iranian dictatorship ran a false flag operation to set up a totally phony designation, which the State Department and bureaucracy went along with, so for a long period of time we were willing to listen to the actual dictatorship while not listening to the resistance, even though the resistance was trying to tell us the truth about the dictatorship, which was lying to us Gingrich acknowledged that Iranians have suffered in exile in Iraq at Camp Liberty and Camp Ashraf where thousands of members and sympathizers of MEK have been living for the past 25 years In my experience, the elements of the National Council of Resistance of Iran who are still inside Iran   and there are thousands of people who are obviously highly quiet about this otherwise they would be picked up by the secret police and killed   but they have been the best source of information on the nuclear program consistently, and have found things when the CIA has been telling us they didn’t exist Gingrich said,  And I hope that this administration will now be part of this process of beginning to unravel both the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  IRGC  and then, ultimately, the dictatorship That unraveling should include the U S  designating the IRGC a terrorist organization, which would have a direct impact on the Iranian economy, according to Gingrich Gingrich said in his remarks that the extent of the danger posed by Iran cannot be understated As long as that dictatorship is in power, as long as it’s able to spend money, as long as it is able to project terrorism around the world, it is ultimately a mortal danger to the United States,  Gingrich said   And of course, it was a terrible thing for the Iranian people A dictatorship which, in 1988, killed 30,000 people, something which for some reason The New York Times and The Washington Post don’t find to be horrifying,  Gingrich said Gingrich detailed the Iran’s aspirations in a chilling laundry list You have a repressive dictatorship which projects power now all the way to the Mediterranean, has plans to build a port in Lebanon that it would control, has plans to build missile factories in both Syria and Lebanon, ultimately designed to destroy Israel, already has helped Hezbollah get something on the order of 75,000 to 100,000 missiles, creating I think a much bigger problem on the northern front for Israel than anybody has come to grips with yet And it’s all going to get worse,  he added Gingrich also praised President Donald Trump on his decision to decertify the JCPOA nuclear deal, calling it  just about exactly the right path  and said that the president’s public remarks about Iran have been bold That includes Trump’s speech to the United Nations, which Gingrich said was  probably the strongest condemnation of Iran, of the Iranian dictatorship, ever uttered in the United Nations Maryam Rajavi, president elect of NCRI, has welcomed the new U S  policy to  condemn the IRGC’s gross violations of human rights  in Iran and  to deny the Iranian regime and especially the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  IRGC  funding for its malign activities, and oppose IRGC activities that extort the wealth of the Iranian people She said acknowledgment that supreme leader Ali Khamenei  oppresses its people, abuses their rights,  and  exports violence, destabilizes its neighbors, and sponsors terrorism abroad,  is a recognition of the illegitimacy of the Iranian regime The event was sponsored by the Organization of Iranian American Communities in the U S "
"Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  SNAP  participation dropped to 41,203,721 as of July 2017, the most recent data available from the USDA, from 42,691,363 in January 2017 when Trump took office According to the latest data, SNAP enrollment decreased by 3 48 percent, or 1,487,642, since Donald Trump began his presidency From May to July alone, nearly 400,000 Americans got off of food stamps, and the trend shows that enrollment has been consistently falling every month of Trump’s presidency Here is the breakdown of how many people dropped off the food stamp rolls each month of 2017 Enrollment continues to be at its lowest level in seven years, thanks to policies Trump implemented at the federal level and ongoing efforts from state legislatures to get people off welfare and back to work Trump’s 2018 budget proposal proposed cuts to SNAP and suggested that states match up to 20 percent of federal money allotted for the food stamp program The president also called for states to expand work requirements for able bodied adults receiving food stamps if they have not already done so  Some federal lawmakers are crafting legislation to implement this policy nationwide, along with time limits on how long food stamp recipients can receive benefits Efforts by state lawmakers had also contributed to the decline in enrollment months before Trump took office, and the numbers show at the federal and state levels The number of people participating in the food stamp program declined by 4 9 percent from July 2016 to July 2017, and the amount of federal money the USDA spends on providing benefits to food stamp recipients also went down by five percent over the same period At the state level, food stamp enrollment is down in 42 out of 50 states, according to the USDA data showing the change in enrollment by state The nationwide decline can be attributed to efforts by individual states beginning in 2014, a year after the Obama administration made slight cuts to the food stamp program as House Republicans urged the administration to push for cuts to the program after enrollment swelled to record highs in 2013 Maine led efforts to implement or reinstate work requirements to participate in the food stamp program that many states delayed putting in place because of the recession in 2014 Other states, such as Alabama and Georgia, caught on to these reforms in 2016 2017 The one thing this continuing trend does not fully take into account is the effect the recent natural disasters in Florida and Texas had on enrollment  The USDA eased restrictions on what items victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma could purchase, allowing those who received food stamps to purchase hot food items, which cannot usually be purchased with benefits The agency also allowed Texans who may have been affected by the storm to receive temporary benefits, which may cause an increase in food stamp enrollment in the state Although the USDA has not released their August or September data yet, the agency included a disclaimer at the bottom of their most recent data saying that it  may include disaster assistance  as a way to forecast a potential spike in enrollment "
"This is because Vegas attacker Stephen Paddock passed background checks for his guns Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt  R  made this very point in the Las Vegas Review Journal on October 21 when he wrote Many, including U S  Sen Dianne Feinstein, D Calif , have said, no law could have stopped the attacker  It should be crystal clear to anybody honestly reporting the facts that Question 1, even if it had been implemented, would have done nothing to prevent this tragedy  The attacker purchased his weapons legally after passing the background check process And it must be noted that the Vegas attacker is only the latest example in a long line of examples of mass public attackers who  purchased his weapons legally after passing the background check process Following the June 14 Alexandria attack, Breitbart News reported a list of some of the mass public attackers who acquired their guns via a background check It is ironic that, after nearly every attack in that list, Democrats hit the ground running, pushing for universal background checks  In other words, they sought to expand background checks from retail point of sale to private point of sale as well If readers are thinking, they may wonder why Democrats would push a failed gun control as a means of preventing another mass public attack  The answer to this is simple  Democrats know that universal background checks are insidious, once implemented they will naturally   and necessarily   lead to a gun registry and, eventually, licensing of gun owners Just look at California  That state adopted universal background checks in the early 1990 s, and they now have firearms registration and require would be gun buyers to obtain a certificate from the state before purchasing a firearm  That certificate does not allow them to carry a gun, it simply allows them to exercise the right to have a gun in their home  On top of this, they have added confiscation laws, an  assault weapons  ban, a  high capacity  magazine ban  that was blocked by a U S  district judge , and so much more The money dumped into Nevada by Bloomberg funded Everytown and other out of state groups secured the passage of Nevada Question 1   i e , universal background checks   on November 8, 2016  But the implementation of those checks was blocked by AG Laxalt after the FBI refused to be part of the mechanism for conducting the checks Some have responded to the Vegas attack by pointing fingers at Laxalt  Those who do this fail to understand that we have background checks on retail gun purchases by federal law, and Paddock bought his guns from federally licensed firearms dealers  which means he underwent background checks Once again, background checks do not stop latent criminals, they only stop actual ones AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of  Bullets with AWR Hawkins,  a Breitbart News podcast  He is also the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter @AWRHawkins  Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart com "
" He exemplifies us because he wants two different things,  said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies   He feels sorry for the DACA  young illegals , and he wants tougher border control, so he is the everyman in this respect,  he added For example, an August poll by America First Policies showed that 71 percent of Americans want to ensure that companies offer open jobs to Americans before foreign workers,  and 59 percent backed a proposal to trim chain migration  But a large chunk of Americans also support pro migrant policies   38 percent of respondents opposed capping the inflow of refugees at 50,000 per year, 37 percent opposed the current rule that immigrants must know English, 44 percent strongly opposed the border wall, and 68 percent said they supported the vague proposal of  providing a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants Trump’s two sided policy is a much better mirror of the public’s two track opinion than the Democrats’ increasingly open favoritism towards legal immigrants and illegal migrants   whom they call  dreamers’   regardless of the cost to Americans Our Dreamers, they make America dream again,  House minority leader Rep  Nancy Pelosi proclaimed during a CNN town hall in October   They’re so lovely and we, frankly, owe a debt to your parents for bringing you here to be such a brilliant part of our future Trump says he will accept the legalization of some illegals, but only if the Democrats back his pro American immigration principles which would safeguard Americans’ salaries by cutting the annual number of immigrant arrivals  In the expected December budget battles, Trump’s demand for fairness to Americans has a huge polling advantage over the Democrats’ huge, expensive Dream Act’ no strings amnesty which strongly favors migrants over Americans  The polls also suggest that Trump’s approach can win a fundamental fight against the establishment to reduce immigration numbers, not just a tactical budget battle against the no strings amnesty sought by Democrat and business The public’s response to immigration  really comes down to the economic impact versus the security impact of immigration   that is where you see a big divide,  said Adam Geller, a pollster for Trump’s election campaign who is now one of the pollsters for the pro Trump non profit, America First Policies The 2016 polling showed that people want immigration slowed so that the neighbor won’t lose a job,  he said   Most Americans have no problem with immigration, and to the extent they do have a problem, it is over illegal immigration or unsecured borders where dangerous criminals can cross the border and committed a crime,  he said Throughout 2016, those economic and crime pressures were amped up by President Barack Obama’s pro migration policies, which gradually pushed Americans to choose between concern for migrants and worries about themselves and their neighbors  In November, the voters decisively favored their neighbors over the media praised flood of Central American youths, Syrian refugees, Mexican seasonal workers, Indian H 1 B visa workers, and especially over the migrants illegally crossing the border But the August poll of 1,201 people also shows shifting and sliding opinions as Americans try to balance their respect for migrants with their worries about uncontrolled immigration, multiple amnesties, crimes, and terrorism For example, the poll shows that 55 percent of respondents approve of a proposal to  deport  most illegal immigrants, and strongly favored a crackdown on illegal immigration   yet 68 percent of respondents also agreed that government should provide  a pathway to citizenship  for illegal immigrants Similarly, the poll showed that only 8 percent of Americans support the current annual inflow of 1 million legal immigrants, and 45 percent say they want fewer than 200,000 immigrants each year  Another question showed that only 10 percent of people were optimistic about current immigration levels when they were asked Projections show that current immigration levels will add roughly 80 million people to the U S  population over the next 50 years  What impact do you think this will have on the environment and quality of life Yet a different question in the poll showed that 49 percent say the current annual level of 1 million immigrants   which is rarely described by the establishment media   is  about the right amount CIS  Total Immigrant Population Hits Record High of 43 7 Million in 2016 "

" I think anybody who thinks   his philosophy is isolationist, I don’t know how you look at that Arab Summit that took place in May in Riyadh,  Bannon said Bannon was speaking at an event organized by the institute   Countering Violent Extremism  Qatar, Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood  in Washington, D C  Bannon was referring to the Arab Islamic American Summit held in Saudi Arabia in May, where Trump met with Arab leaders to organize a united front against ISIS and to stop the financing of terrorism Bannon said that specifically, the point of the summit was to stop the financing of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and also Iran’s aggressive anti Western strategy I don’t think it’s just by happenstance that two weeks after that summit that you saw the blockade of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain  and  Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Qatar,  he said Just eight months into Trump’s term, Bannon also noted, ISIS has largely been wiped out after major defeats in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria  The latter is arguably a more significant defeat for the terror group as Raqqa was the group’s de facto capital in the Middle East  But last week it fell to U S backed troops As Breitbart News reported last week, analysts caution that ISIS has not been destroyed, but with these twin defeats, it has been broken down from a terror state back into a terrorist organization Bannon noted that despite Trump being criticized during the campaign for his perceived lack of foreign policy knowledge, he has achieved a victory that would have been seen as almost impossible just a year ago President Trump has accomplished something that I think people would have mocked and laughed at him in the campaign,  Bannon said   Raqqa fell the other day, the physical destruction of ISIS’s caliphate, which shocked the world with its rapid rise He put the victory down to changing the strategy from a war of attrition, to a war of annihilation In eight months of President Trump’s strategy, executed by General Mattis, and that strategy was not a war of attrition, he was very specific from day one, this is a war of annihilation   we will annihilate the caliphate’ and that’s been accomplished,  he said Adam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York  Follow Adam on Twitter  @AdamShawNY"

" The threat to Open Enrollment this year is very real,  wrote Josh Peck, a former Obama administration official, in an analysis published on Medium Peck, who served as Healthcare gov’s chief marketing officer, based his analysis on Obama administration studies that linked enrollments with the amount of money spent on television ads, digital ads, phone calls, and emails People will be hurt by the administration’s actions,  he said Peck  crunched the numbers  from the data in the studies after taking the news that the Trump administration slashed the advertising budget for Obamacare by 90 percent from  100 million to  10 million into account Obamacare advocates like Peck argue that the slashed budget will mean that fewer people would take advantage of financial assistance or know when the open enrollment period begins, even after he called his analysis  the best case scenario Health and Human Services spokesperson Matt Lloyd said that contrary to Peck’s analysis, advertising campaigns had not been linked to increased enrollment on the Obamacare exchanges As Obamacare enters its fifth open enrollment period, it is clear that massive advertising campaigns have not delivered substantial gains in coverage on Obamacare’s exchanges,  Lloyd said in a statement Last year, fewer Americans bought Obamacare coverage despite the previous Administration nearly doubling the advertising budget  More marketing will not convince Americans to sign up for failed coverage they cannot afford or that does not meet their needs,  he added "
"Sen  Cornyn has taken the nomination of Russ Vought to be Deputy Director of President Donald Trump’s Office of Management and Budget  OMB  hostage under the pretext that he wants more hurricane relief money for Texas from the Trump administration  If done in the private sector, this would be defined as extortion, yet it is a common practice in Washington, DC The true reason for the hold likely is far more disturbing  It might be that Sen  Cornyn’s actions are motivated by revenge   revenge against an arm of The Heritage Foundation  Heritage Action for America  for setting up a scorecard of votes  Also, revenge against the conservative movement for being critical of the Senate leadership’s feckless efforts to implement the Trump agenda  If true, it is sad that establishment Senators think they can use the power of government to exact revenge against opponents One irony in this fight is that Russ Vought originally was a staffer for Sen  Phil Gramm  R TX    Sen  Cornyn’s predecessor  Sen  Cornyn replaced Sen  Gramm in 2002, after Gramm retired  Vought also served the people of Texas by working for Rep  Jeb Hensarling  R TX  when he was head of the Republican Study Committee  After years of service to the people of Texas, Sen  Cornyn has decided to pay back Vought by denying him Senate confirmation to serve in the Trump administration One would expect a liberal Democrat   not a member of the Republican leadership   to hold up Vought’s nomination According to Axios Vought is a top White House priority and is considered a leader in the conservative movement  Social conservatives rallied around him and his profile exploded after his confirmation hearing in June when he clashed with Sen  Bernie Sanders over his religious beliefs  Vought wrote a blog post in which he described his Christian faith and said that those who do not accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior  stand condemned  Sanders then accused him of  racism and bigotry  because of that post Vought has been attacked by left wing Senators for being a devout Christian  One would think that Sen  Cornyn could put aside his petty fight with the conservative movement to protect a Christian nominee from anti Christian attacks  It would not have been a surprise for socialist Sens  Bernie Sanders  I VT  or left winger Elizabeth Warren  D MA  to hold up a nominee for his Christian beliefs  Republicans in the Senate should be pushing this nomination as a way to protect religious freedom and the idea that a nominee expressing his religious beliefs should not be a disqualifier to serve in the executive branch of the federal government  This hold serves the purposes of many on the anti Christian left who want to paint all Christians as hate mongers According to Jonathan Swann of Axios on October 19, 2017 Texas Sen  John Cornyn is frustrating both administration officials and conservative movement leaders by holding up the confirmation of Russ Vought to be Mick Mulvaney’s right hand man at the Office of Management and Budget  Cornyn   a member of Senate leadership who has a strong say over the floor schedule   has made it clear that Vought will be held up until he gets more funding for Texas’ hurricane relief, according to three sources close to the situation  It’s unclear how Cornyn has phrased his demand or how much extra money, exactly, he’s asking for, but his message has been heard loud and clear by top Trump administration officials This expressed reason to hold up Vought’s nomination is likely a ruse  Russ Vought was a former staffer for Heritage Action for America, the sister organization of The Heritage Foundation, and this may be Cornyn’s way of paying back the organization for putting together a scorecard of votes  Heritage Action’s tough scorecard of votes for Members of Congress has angered some moderate Republicans  Senator Cornyn has a pathetic 47  Heritage Action score and he may be so embarrassed about his score that he, and his staff, are exacting revenge Senator Cornyn has the power to  hold  a nominee by threatening to filibuster and object to all agreements expediting Vought’s nomination  To get a nominee passed, it is common practice in the Senate to get the consent of all members to schedule a vote  In this case, Sen  Cornyn is the only known Senator objecting to Vought’s confirmation to serve at OMB To be clear, there is nothing wrong with Senators holding up the confirmation of nominees, if they oppose confirmation  Also, sometimes a Senator will hold up a nominee to demand documents, testimony, or to force executive branch to take certain actions when they support confirmation of a nominee  This is a different type of case Sen  Cornyn’s request makes little sense, because Congress can include more money for Texas in the upcoming appropriations or supplemental hurricane relief bills expected to be cleared later this year  The Administration will have little to do with the crafting of the appropriations legislation, because it will be in the domain of the legislative branch of the federal government to pass bills Sen  Cornyn should be the one on the Senate floor demanding a vote for a

" Steve Bannon’s speech was the one that really fired up this convention,  said State Senator Joel Anderson  R Alpine   It’s easy as a California Republican to lose heart when you consider the kind of policy making coming out of Sacramento  Bannon was able to remind people that, nationally, we are making great strides and gave everyone here a reason to work harder than ever California Republicans are often seen nowadays as a moderate bunch  But the party faithful warmed quickly to Bannon’s message of challenging the Washington establishment In fact, Bannon’s address caused more buzz at the convention than did speeches from more traditional conservative figures  House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy  R Bakersfield , Sen  Tom Cotton  R AR , Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and Fox News show host Judge Janine Pirro Stepping out from behind the podium, comfortably walking about the stage, Bannon gave a forty minute long extemporaneous speech covering a myriad of issues that began with effusive praise of President Donald Trump  He continued by emphasizing the importance of winning and how victories beget victories, and about the great challenge ahead in taking on the  corporatists, lobbyists, consultants, and the politicians they control Bannon’s speech was equal parts praise for President Trump and his policies  a call to action against the GOP establishment  a strong critique of former President George W  Bush and U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ ’s recent speeches against Trump  and words of strong encouragement for the activists in the audience Sen  Cotton,, a favorite of conservatives, hammered the Democrats who run California’s government for making California a  sanctuary state  for those here in violation of federal immigration laws  He also focused on the massive gas tax recently passed by Democrats in Sacramento   If you live in West L A  or San Francisco and you have the money to afford a Tesla, maybe you’ll be OK,  Cotton told delegates   What about the farmer in the Central Valley who has a pickup truck and needs to fill it up three times a week Rep McCarthy also praised President Trump   and also, like Cotton, blasted Democrats in Sacramento for their left wing, progressive agenda  McCarthy also admonished those Republicans in the state legislature who have recently been voting with Democrats, warning that they will not win a majority by being Democrat light While there was a lot of enthusiasm among the delegates present, the road ahead for California Republicans looks rocky  Delegates did pass a change in party rules that allows the party to endorse primary candidates at their next convention, ostensibly to ensure at least one candidate survives the  jungle  primary  However, the next scheduled convention is in early May, long after candidate filing is closed and ballots are printed  In 2016 two Democrats   then Attorney General Kamala Harris and then U S  Rep Loretta Sanchez   made the runoff for U S  Senate, with no Republican on the general election ballot  There is a legitimate concern that this will happen again with the governor’s race and U S  Senate race in 2018 Moreover, Democrats nationally are targeting about a half dozen GOP held House seats in California that voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election In a somewhat controversial move, convention delegates approved a change in the party’s rules allowing for the party to set up a special account from which to pay the chairman an unspecified salary  Nothing was in that change to the rules that would require any disclosure about what persons or companies are making contributions into that special fund  Up until this point the chairmanship has always been a volunteer held position Jon Fleischman is the Politics Editor for Breitbart California  You can follow him on Twitter here "

"Sens  Dianne Feinstein  D CA  and Chris Murphy  D CT  were loud and proud for gun control in the immediate aftermath of the Vegas attack  Together, with their Democrat colleagues and surrogates, they voiced support for nine different gun controls between October 2 and October 11  Those controls included an  assault weapons  ban, universal background checks, a ban on bump stocks, a ban on semiautomatic guns, and a ban on  high capacity  magazines But things took a turn toward a more hushed tone as polls showed that Americans emerged from the Vegas attack still holding gun rights as more important than gun control  The polling was released between October 11 and October 22, with California’s KPCC finally declaring,  Las Vegas shooting didn’t change anyone’s mind about guns As the polls were coming in, Sen  Chuck Schumer  D NY  remembered that November 2018 is fast approaching and Democrat Senators in red states are in trouble if they are tied too closely to gun control  So Schumer urged his colleagues to avoid gun control as the budget debates began Yet even as the Democrats find their hands tied on gun control, Speaker Ryan remains unmoved on the Hearing Protection Act and national reciprocity for concealed carry  The Hearing Protection Act which would have removed the  200 federal tax on suppressor sales was shelved by Ryan just two days after the Vegas attack, and national reciprocity for concealed carry has been languishing in the House of Representatives since January 3, 2017 On September 11, Breitbart News quoted Gun Owners of America’s Larry Pratt saying Ryan’s inaction on national reciprocity gives  dirtbags  the upper hand over law abiding citizens who cannot always carry their guns state to state because of our nation’s crazy patchwork of concealed carry laws  National reciprocity would end that crazy patchwork by making the concealed carry permit of any one state valid in the other 49 Suppressors had nothing to do with the Vegas attack, where law abiding citizens were the victims   rather than the culprits   of a heinous crime  It is time to pass the pro gun legislation that has, until now, simply been left on the sidelines AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast  He is also the political analyst for Armed American Radio  Follow him on Twitter @AWRHawkins  Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart com "

"This week’s broadside comes from Trump hating comedienne Kathy Griffin, who claims she paid Bloom  40,000 for two days of work that only made things worse, much worse Before we get into the juicy details, one wonders who is more horrified by this story   Bloom or the left wing Los Angeles Times  After all, it was the Los Angeles Times that just a few days ago published a gushing profile of Bloom, obviously meant to rehabilitate her image after the disastrous fallout from her defense of Harvey Weinstein and Roy Price, two powerful movie executives accused of sexual misconduct But stepping all over this beautifully crafted  career rehab parade is Griffin, who is accusing Bloom of gross incompetence and flat out  fame whoring  Bloom denies pretty much everything Griffin told the Daily Beast Sunday, but as you will see, a pattern is beginning to develop After Griffin infamously photographed herself brandishing a mock up of President Trump’s bloody, severed head, she hired Bloom to save her career, which, if you recall, imploded even faster than Bloom has this month For reasons involving basic human decency, a bunch of Griffin’s tour dates were canceled  Even hard left CNN, which has itself wished Trump dead, dropped her from its annual New Year’s Eve coverage According to Griffin, though, Bloom had no idea what she was doing  First, there was Griffin’s pathetic and disastrous  he broke me  press conference in Bloom’s law office That press conference exacerbated my situation greatly,  Griffin told the Daily Beast   I didn’t know I was going to her office, and that I would be under a fucking banner that said  Lisabloom com,’ and that she would hand me a coffee cup that said  Lisabloom com ’ She added,  It was one of the worst days of my life For her part, Bloom claims Griffin ignored her instructions and notes during the press conference After the presser, Griffin says she was ushered into a room while Bloom’s husband blocked the door   Lisa was outside doing interviews in the hallway fame whoring which we didn’t know at the time,  Griffin claims  According to her, they only got out of the room by demanding that Bloom’s husband remove his hand Then, Griffin says, Bloom would not leave her alone  Desperate to ride Griffin’s infamy into television appearances for herself, although Griffin kept saying no, she says Bloom would not stop  badgering  her so that they could appear together on Good Morning America, which would only be the beginning of an extensive media campaign for the both of them In Griffin’s mind, the media strategy she hired Bloom for was a total failure, one she was willing to forgive and move on   But Lisa and her husband would not stop blowing up my phone and my boyfriend’s phone  And it was not only GMA, but this was just the beginning of a press tour To describe Bloom, Griffin uses words like  fame whoring,   badgering,   volatile,   disaster,  and  hotheaded So, we can now add Griffin’s testimony to last week’s story about Bloom’s alleged threatening of the Hollywood Reporter’s Kim Masters with crippling lawsuits to shield Roy Price, the former head of Amazon studios, who was fired last week over allegations of sexual misconduct The week prior to that, we learned through leaked emails that Bloom sought to discredit Weinstein’s accusers and that the Weinstein Company asked that she resign over her incompetence and conflict of interest   Bloom has a miniseries deal with Weinstein The most damning allegations, though, were launched by actress Rose McGowan, who claims Bloom tried to pay her off to protect Weinstein Bloom denies all of it Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC  Follow his Facebook Page here "
