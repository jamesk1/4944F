"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-new-outreach-to-democrats-health-care-1507387781President       Donald Trump       said on Saturday that he had spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) a day earlier to discuss renewing efforts to pass health-care legislation.“I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Who knows!”Mr. Schumer confirmed the call and said the president told him he “wanted to make another run at repeal and replace,” using the Republican shorthand for rolling back the Affordable Care Act.“I told the president that’s off the table,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “If he wants to work together to improve the existing health-care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.”A Democratic aide said that bipartisan efforts were hampered by the administration’s move on Friday to scale back an Obama-era requirement that employer-provided health benefits include contraception. The White House, asked for more information about the president’s call with Mr. Schumer, said it had “nothing more to add at this time.” Senate GOP leaders late last month ended their latest bid to repeal the Affordable Care Act after the plan failed to gain sufficient traction. At the time, Mr. Trump said he planned to negotiate with Democrats on health-care legislation. He also predicted that Republicans would hold a vote on health care early next year. GOP leaders said at the time that they were moving on to an effort to overhaul the tax code but would seek to revisit health care.The outreach to Mr. Schumer marks the president’s latest effort to deal with Democrats as his frustration grows with his own party’s congressional leaders. Mr. Trump stunned Republicans last month when he overrode pleas from GOP congressional leaders and sided with Democrats on a proposal to attach emergency aid for Hurricane Harvey victims to measures to keep the government funded and its borrowing limit suspended until mid-December. In a subsequent dinner with Mr. Schumer and House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       (D., Calif.), Mr. Trump indicated he was open to a deal with Democrats on legislation that would give legal status to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.Mr. Trump’s tweet on health care Saturday morning came amid a flurry of other online messages targeting late-night comedians and the news media. Mr. Trump, who is spending a rare weekend at the White House, is set to head to North Carolina later Saturday for a fundraiser that will raise money for his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee. After tweeting on Saturday, he headed to his golf club in Virginia.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-moves-ratchet-up-pressure-on-congress-1507936683WASHINGTON—President       Donald Trump       is looking to advance his proposed tax overhaul this week, wooing key Republican senators in hopes of jump-starting a legislative agenda that has faltered despite the party’s control of Washington.An important test is likely to come Thursday, when the Senate begins voting on a budget resolution that will determine whether Republicans can pass the tax package without any Democratic support. It is part of a challenging agenda that Congress must tackle by year-end, an agenda Mr. Trump has added to with recent moves on health care and Iran.Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority and can lose no more than two votes to pass the budget measure that would give Mr. Trump the clearest path toward enacting the tax package and notching the most consequential legislative victory of his presidency.One potential holdout is Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.), who hasn’t yet said how he would vote but has voiced concerns about “spending too much money.” After speaking to the White House budget director,       Mick Mulvaney,        Mr. Paul said in an interview Friday: “He knows what our concerns are, and we’re hoping they can fix those concerns.”With a sharp focus on Mr. Paul, the president spent hours golfing with the senator on Sunday at the Trump National Golf Club in Northern Virginia. Afterward, Mr. Paul spoke to reporters and voiced broad support for the goal of cutting taxes, though he didn’t indicate how he would vote on the underlying budget measure that could determine the tax package’s fate.In recent days Mr. Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on Congress, adding to lawmakers’ already complicated to-do list. He is to meet Monday with Senate Republican leader       Mitch McConnell       of Kentucky for a discussion about budget and tax issues, a White House official said Sunday.In the span of about 15 hours from Thursday night to Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump canceled crucial payments under the Affordable Care Act and delivered a stiff blow to the agreement aimed at curtailing Iran’s nuclear program. He put the onus on Congress to fix both.Last month, he removed protection for immigrants brought to the country as children, and told Congress to find a new way to allow them to stay before 690,000 face deportation. The moves add a trio of contentious issues to an already crowded legislative agenda when Republican leaders had hoped to focus on overhauling the federal tax code, a task that hasn’t been accomplished in three decades.“Trump is following through on being a disruptive force that his core base of support loves to see,” said       Ron Bonjean,        a Republican strategist who has assisted the Trump White House. “Trump expects Republicans to follow through on tax reform and if adding to the workload creates more headaches for Congress, that probably won’t be his top concern.”Yet       Dan Meyer,        who was head of legislative affairs for former President       George W. Bush,        compared Mr. Trump’s decisions to “passing the hot potato” and suggested the president needs to work more closely with Republican leaders.“It’s easy to disrupt. It’s not as easy to put it back together again,” he said. “You don’t get the impression that they’re working as a seamless team, that’s for sure.”Mr. Trump’s actions last week move the Republican-controlled Congress into new territory, beyond the divides created earlier this year when GOP lawmakers were caught off guard by the president’s surprise actions on transgender people serving in the military or angry tweets aimed at Attorney General       Jeff Sessions.      Now, lawmakers are in a position of having to respond not just with words but with legislative action, creating more serious pressures for congressional Republicans who already had problems advancing high-priority bills.“It’s not enough to simply dump everything in Congress’ lap and say ’deal with it,’” said       Brian Walsh,        who spent years as a Republican strategist. He said Mr. Trump may be setting up fellow Republicans for failure. “What specifically is he advocating for? What is the exact plan?”But       Sam Geduldig,        a lobbyist and former House GOP leadership aide, said Congress needs to get some practice at “doing important things.”“Congress has an opportunity to write legislation—they should take it,” Mr. Geduldig said.The president also has urged voters to oust lawmakers who don’t support his tax overhaul plan this year; he phoned his former chief strategist,       Steve Bannon,        to offer encouragement after Mr. Bannon appeared on Fox News on Monday vowing to unseat sitting Republicans who don’t actively support the president’s agenda, said two people familiar with the call.“Congress always works better on deadline,” said       Marc Short,        the president’s legislative affairs director. “And there are some end-of-year deadlines approaching that provide an opportunity to get more done.”By turning the spotlight on Congress—even his fellow Republicans—Mr. Trump will find an easy political foil, said       Alex Conant,        a Republican strategist.“The only thing in Washington that’s less popular than Trump is Congress,” Mr. Conant said.Republicans are concerned about the growing workload. “Congress can’t chew gum, let alone walk and chew gum,” one House Republican aide said Friday.Mr. Short said the best chance for a deal between Congress and the president, who touted his negotiation skills honed from a career in real estate and marketing, may be immigration.Mr. Trump left some wondering if an immigration deal was possible when he put forward dozens of enforcement policies that he said he wanted as part of legislation to help young, undocumented immigrants that have previously been protected from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. But the White House is optimistic.“That’s one that’s likely to be accomplished,” Mr. Short said. “The president says he wants to work with Democrats. Democrats say this is something they want, and there are some elements we want.”Mr. Trump’s decision to shift the Iran deal back to Capitol Hill adds a new debate over the next 60 days. Some Republicans last week said they were ready to immediately impose sanctions on Iran. Others said that would do little to curb Tehran, which already received an infusion of cash when sanctions were first lifted under the deal.“I do not believe it would be smart for us to get out of the agreement at this point,” House Armed Services Committee Chairman       Mac Thornberry       (R., Texas), who opposed the Iran deal, said last week. “Iran already got much of the benefit—a plane load of cash, relaxation of sanctions. If we give them an excuse to walk away, they can take that cash and have a nuclear weapon in a very short amount of time,” he said.If agreement on legislative changes for health care, taxes and immigration remains elusive, White House aides made clear that Mr. Trump will claim victory for undercutting the Iran deal, ending billions of dollars in payments to health insurers, and putting hundreds of thousands of immigrants on notice for deportation.Mr. Trump’s moves come after he came up short in the Alabama Senate primary late last month, when he opposed       Roy Moore,        a former state Supreme Court justice who is beloved by the evangelical movement. The defeat left Mr. Trump fuming, and threatened to create some distance between the president and his base.Fulfilling his campaign promises was the overriding theme of a 30-minute speech the president delivered on Friday to evangelical voters, just three hours before he stood alone in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House and vowed to cancel the Iranian nuclear agreement unless Congress addresses his concerns.“In the last 10 months, we have followed through on one promise after another,” Mr. Trump told the Values Voter Summit in Washington. “I didn’t have a schedule. But if I did have a schedule, I would say we are substantially ahead of schedule.”—Janet Hook, Rebecca Ballhaus and Laura Meckler contributed to this article. Write to Michael C.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-wont-certify-iran-is-complying-with-nuclear-deal-seeks-trigger-points-for-sanctions-1507908636WASHINGTON—President       Donald Trump       took aim Friday at the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, vowing to end U.S. participation in the landmark deal unless Congress and U.S. allies are able to deliver on punitive measures targeting Tehran’s missile program, its support for regional militant groups, and any future nuclear activities.As a first step, Mr. Trump refused to certify to Congress under a U.S. law that Iran was complying with its obligations under the nuclear agreement, charging that the country had violated the terms of the deal. Going further, Mr. Trump said if efforts to address his concerns fall short, he would terminate the accord. “It is under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me, as president, at any time,” he said.As U.S. president, Mr. Trump has wide, long-term latitude over the fate of the agreement, but lacks the ability under the accord’s complicated terms to immediately abolish it.Mr. Trump, reiterating his fierce opposition to the terms of the deal, announced his decision after issuing a lengthy denunciation of what he called a “rogue regime” run by radicals.“Iran is under the control of a fanatical regime,” Mr. Trump said in a speech at the White House, adding it has “spread death, destruction and chaos all around the globe.”Detailing grievances against Iran going back to 1979, the year of the country’s Islamic revolution, Mr. Trump broadly condemned the country’s rulers.“Iranian aggression continues to this day,” he said. “The regime remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.”In his threat, the president applied a well-practiced tactic of pressing for changes in pre-existing arrangements and abandoning them if he doesn’t succeed. He has taken a similar approach to the Paris climate accord and the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as to domestic programs such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.Mr. Trump’s move on Friday touches off high-pressure negotiations in Washington and European capitals over the future of the accord, and his action drew intensive world-wide attention. Iran’s president       Hassan Rouhani       denounced Mr. Trump’s comments in a televised speech, saying: “The Iranian people will not bend down before a dictator.”Israeli Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu       called Mr. Trump’s move to deny Iran’s compliance with the deal courageous, saying the U.S. leader had “boldly confronted Iran’s terrorist regime.” ​Saudi Arabia, a leading Sunni Muslim power and Shiite-majority Iran’s main rival in the Middle East, also threw its support behind Mr. Trump’s stance.European officials pushed back, however, on his threat to scuttle the deal if his terms can’t be satisfied.“It is not a bilateral agreement. It does not belong to any single country and it is not up to any single country to terminate,” the European Union’s Foreign Policy Chief       Federica Mogherini       told reporters. German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        French President       Emmanuel Macron,        and British Prime Minister       Theresa May,        whose countries are parties to the accord, said in a joint statement they remained committed to the agreement “and its full implementation by all sides.” China, another party to the deal, has also signaled its desire to keep it intact, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying Tuesday it was in the interest of all sides to continue its implementation. A law passed in 2015 to give Congress oversight of the nuclear deal requires the president to tell Congress every 90 days whether Iran is complying. If the president doesn’t do so, it triggers a 60-day process for lawmakers to weigh whether to reimpose sanctions under expedited consideration.However, Mr. Trump didn’t call on Congress to reimpose sanctions immediately, and instead said he supported efforts of Republicans in Congress to craft legislation that would amend the 2015 U.S. oversight bill to reimpose sanctions on Iran if it violates enhanced and existing restrictions on its nuclear program.Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been working with Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       on amending the oversight law, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, known in Washington as INARA. Sens. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) have also been involved in crafting the amended legislation.Mr. Corker, despite a public feud with Mr. Trump that has spilled into             Twitter                   posts, said on Friday that he expects to introduce the legislation in the next week or two.Mr. Trump highlighted concerns with “sunset clauses” in the nuclear deal that allow nuclear restrictions to expire. Mr. Tillerson, briefing reporters, said the U.S. envisions a “successor deal” to address those concerns.A current draft of the bill also would change the frequency of presidential certification required from every quarter to twice a year.The legislative process is likely to require time and painstaking negotiations. Mr. Tillerson said he hoped Congress would amend the legislation before Mr. Trump next faces another certification deadline in January, but admitted the process won’t be a “slam dunk.”Mr. Rubio said he backed Mr. Trump’s move to withhold support for the deal and said he thought the U.S. should leave the accord and reimpose sanctions. “I have serious doubts about whether it is even possible to fix such a dangerously flawed agreement,” he said.However, Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he disagreed with Mr. Trump’s “reckless political decision and his subsequent threat to Congress.” Mr. Cardin voted against the deal in 2015 but said Friday he backed staying in it and rigorously enforcing it.            VIEW Interactive          Mr. Corker’s measure would contain what Mr. Tillerson called “trigger points” that would reimpose sanctions, for example, if Iran violates restrictions spelled out in the legislation. The legislation would set stricter limits than those contained in the nuclear accord. Mr. Corker’s office said the bill would be “effectively ridding the JCPOA of its sunset provisions as they apply to U.S. sanctions.” It will also bolster the verification powers of the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog and limiting Iran’s centrifuge program.As it works to toughen the U.S. law, the administration also will seek talks with European partners to address key concerns, Mr. Tillerson said.Asked if the EU would be interested in negotiating a “successor” agreement, Ms. Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, said “the agreement is working, has been implemented, continues to be implemented…I would expect all sides to stick to it.”European officials and former U.S. officials involved in negotiating the deal are concerned that by reimposing sanctions for reasons not covered by the original nuclear deal, the U.S. stands to be in breach of the international agreement, setting in motion a sequence of events that could lead to the deal’s collapse.Mr. Trump has the power to unilaterally end U.S. participation in the deal by halting the U.S. sanctions relief that Iran was promised under the accord. Doing so, however, wouldn’t necessarily abolish the agreement, as other countries and Iran could choose to continue to follow it.Reinstating U.S. sanctions also could lead Iran to halt its commitments under the deal if Tehran doesn’t receive the economic relief it expected. Iran’s withdrawal and return to now-banned nuclear activities would effectively nullify the agreement.Mr. Trump has other options under the complex deal. He could say that Iran has committed a material breach of the terms and initiate a dispute resolution process ​that could lead to a vote in the U.N. Security Council. In such a vote, the U.S.’s veto could result in the resumption of broad, punitive international sanctions. However, the appearances of a U.S. move to force a vote that way would be challenging, former officials involved in the negotiations said.Among other steps outlined by Mr. Trump, the U.S. will target the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s elite military branch, which Mr. Trump said has hijacked large portions of Iran’s economy.The IRGC won’t be classified formally as a foreign terrorist organization under U.S. laws that would expose it to more punitive action, officials said. Instead, the Treasury Department announced on Friday that it is designating the group under as a terror ​organization under an executive order that was created after Sept. 11, 2001 to target terrorist financing.Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior Iran analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that even though large parts of the IRGC has already been sanctioned under past executive orders, the latest designation could inflict economic damage.“This is a major course correction” by Washington, Mr. Ben Taleblu said. Besides expanding the sanctions to the entire IRGC, the administration is also issuing the order under a terrorism designation, which ratchets up the stigma for firms and individuals thinking about doing business with the group or any of its affiliates.—Laurence Norman, Ian Talley, Asa Fitch and Rory Jones contributed to this article.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/veteran-affairs-head-interviews-for-health-and-human-services-post-1507938721       David Shulkin,        the current U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs and a holdover from the Obama administration, has been interviewed by the White House for the top job at Health and Human Services, according to sources familiar with the meetings.He is one of a number of leading contenders for the position, which has been vacant since late September when former HHS Secretary       Tom Price       resigned over criticism of his use of private and military planes.Other potential candidates include       Seema Verma,        the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to a White House official. Others who also may be in the running are former Pennsylvania Sen.       Rick Santorum,        former Louisiana Gov.       Bobby Jindal,        New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       and       John Fleming,        currently HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for health technology reform.Representatives from multiple veteran advocacy groups said rumors of Dr. Shulkin’s interest in switching agencies has been known among some in the community. A VA spokeswoman would neither confirm nor deny Dr. Shulkin’s interview, and a spokesman referred all questions about cabinet-level positions to the White House.The White House official said that Dr. Shulkin has “made his case” for becoming the next department secretary. Working against him might be the success he has had at the VA, this person said. Both Dr. Shulkin and Ms. Verma have done well in their present positions—a reason President       Donald Trump       may have no wish to move them, the official said.“Sometimes you promote someone who’s doing a great job,” the official said. “On the other hand, these are two highly functioning, effective officials doing a good job where they are. And they’re very little trouble.”Dr. Shulkin, a physician, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for his current position and has extensive experience in health-care management.He is a holdover from former President       Barack Obama’s       administration, and was first appointed by Mr. Obama to be the head of the VA’s health-care arm under then-Secretary       Robert McDonald.       He served in that role for more than a year before being tapped for the top job at the department by Mr. Trump.The White House interview indicates Mr. Trump may be moving quickly to fill the position as he undertakes a sweeping administrative effort to roll back the Affordable Care Act. The position oversees a $1 trillion agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid and implementation of the health law.Dr. Shulkin’s short tenure has helped push through a number of popular measures including expanding the GI Bill and employee-accountability measures, which have drawn bipartisan praise in Congress and from influential veteran advocacy groups.While lawmakers from both parties have lauded Dr. Shulkin’s overall performance, he has also drawn some criticism from the VA’s major union and from some veterans groups that say he has put too much focus on punishing workers and moved the department toward more use of private-sector doctors. He also recently has been ensnared in questions about his official travel, prompting the department’s inspector general to look into the matter.Legislators and veterans groups also await his promised unveiling of plans to address the department’s use of private-sector care. It could lead to a fight in Congress over the department’s future and whether it will move toward more private-sector reliance.Before joining the VA, Dr. Shulkin served in a variety of executive roles in private hospital systems, including as chief executive of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-collins-to-remain-in-u-s-senate-1507900816Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, a centrist Republican who has been a decisive vote in thwarting some of President       Donald Trump’s       legislative agenda, on Friday ended months of speculation and said she would not quit the Senate to run for governor.Ms. Collins seriously considered running for governor in 2018 to succeed two-term Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who is barred from running for another term, instead of finishing her Senate term, which ends in 2020.“I realized how much remains to be done in a divided and troubled Washington if we are to serve the people of our states,” she said in announcing her decision to a business group in Rockport, Maine. “I am a congenital optimist, and I continue to believe that Congress can—and will—be more productive.”Her decision was a relief to many of her Senate colleagues, who see her as an important bridge builder in a polarized Senate, and to Republicans who worried that her seat would have been be hard for the party to hold in 2020 if she left.But her decision to stay may not be so welcome to Trump supporters and conservatives. Ms. Collins has been a vocal Trump critic and a thorn in the side of GOP leaders. She cast one of the deciding votes that killed GOP legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.She is very popular in Maine, having won re-election to the Senate in 2014 with 68% of the vote.But running for governor wouldn’t have been a cakewalk. She faces animosity from Mr. LePage, who has criticized her for voting against the GOP health-care bill. And she would have faced a primary fight against more conservative members of the GOP, including LePage protégé Mary Mayhew, former Maine health commissioner.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-split-over-trumps-move-to-end-health-subsidies-1507930952WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s decision to end payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act triggered an immediate dispute Friday among Republicans over whether to reverse the decision and shore up the nation’s insurance markets or embrace Mr. Trump’s move.That fight is likely to intensify upon the announcement of a bipartisan deal to guarantee the insurer payments, which is expected to be released within days, according to people familiar with the talks. The deal, led by Sens.       Lamar Alexander       (R., Tenn.) and       Patty Murray       (D., Wash.), would authorize the payments Mr. Trump is ending, while also providing states some flexibility under the ACA.Republicans were largely caught by surprise by Mr. Trump’s double-barreled blow to the ACA on Thursday, when he issued an executive order that relaxes insurance regulations followed by the announcement that he is ending “cost-sharing reduction” payments to insurers, which help them subsidize out-of-pocket costs for some low-income consumers.GOP lawmakers’ inability to unify around a plan to repeal and replace the 2010 health law, often called Obamacare, left their path uncertain in reacting to Mr. Trump. Many conservatives see any move to authorize the payments as bolstering the ACA, a law they promised to repeal. But some GOP leaders fear that fallout from ending the payments, including higher premiums for some consumers, could hand Democrats a powerful political issue.“Republicans are the governing party and they own our health care system, for better or for worse,” said GOP strategist Alex Conant, a partner at Firehouse Strategies, which works with health insurers. “If people are unhappy with their access to health care, they’re going to blame the people in charge, which is Republicans.”Mr. Trump has signaled he would be open to an agreement along the lines being discussed by Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray, as long as certain demands are met. White House aides have floated the idea of bundling the payments with funding for a border wall, though that proposal is toxic to Democrats.Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) is expected to introduce his own legislation next week that would fund the payments to insurers, but in combination with more conservative provisions than those likely to be included in an Alexander-Murray deal.Mr. Trump’s decision to end the payments is seen by some on Capitol Hill as a negotiating tactic to pressure Republicans and Democrats to reach a deal. “If the Democratic leaders could come over to the White House ... we’ll negotiate some deal that’s good for everybody,” the president said Friday.But the emerging Alexander-Murray deal faces opposition from many House Republicans, aides said, since most conservatives view the subsidy payments as an insurance industry bailout.“We haven’t cut taxes yet. We haven’t repealed Obamacare yet,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), said in an interview. “Now some members of our conference are talking about bailouts for insurance companies.…Really?”But others in Congress support the idea of passing legislation to fund the payments, essentially taking the matter out of the White House’s hands. Rep. Leonard Lance (R., N.J.) is part of a bipartisan House group with Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.) and others that has proposed legislation similar to that under discussion by Sens. Alexander and Murray.“We should stabilize the situation in the short term,” Mr. Lance said in an interview. “I do think the public wants bipartisan cooperation in reforming the system.”Democrats said Trump’s actions ensured that Republicans would bear the political consequence of any voter unhappiness with the health care system. “Their destructive actions, and the actions of the president, are going to fall on their backs,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).In ending the payments, administration officials cited a lawsuit filed by House Republicans against the Obama administration in 2014, contending that the payments weren’t approved by Congress as required. That argument may now be moot, but 15 states, led by California, filed their own lawsuit on Friday seeking to force the administration to continue making the monthly payments.“It’s long past time that President Trump learn that he doesn’t just get to pick and choose which laws he’ll follow or which bills he’ll pay,” said California Attorney General       Xavier Becerra.      The states argue that ending the payments will cause irreparable harm, and that the administration’s sudden decision violates laws requiring it to lay out orderly and transparent reasoning for its actions. But several legal experts said the administration’s justification for cutting off the payments is likely sound.The payments’ termination on Oct. 18 is widely expected by health analysts to undermine the stability of the individual insurance market, where people can buy insurance if they don’t get it through work. About seven million people benefit from the cost-sharing reduction payments.Some insurers may seek to abandon the ACA’s exchanges immediately, although state regulations in some cases limit their ability to do so. Those defections, and more over time, could leave swaths of the country with no insurers on the exchanges.At the same time, premiums for one of the ACA’s most popular plans would be 25% higher in 2020, and the federal deficit would increase by $194 billion by 2026, as a result of ending the payments, according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Hours before the White House announced it was ending the insurer payments Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to pursue potentially far-reaching regulatory changes to the health insurance industry.The result, most health analysts say, will be higher premiums for older and sicker people, while younger and healthier consumers see their costs drop as limits are lifted on the sale of shorter-term, less-comprehensive plans.Some Republicans said they would benefit from Mr. Trump’s actions, since voters put the GOP in charge to change the system. “We cannot continue the status quo,” said Rep. Mark Walker (R., N.C.).—Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-contender-taylor-laments-central-banks-precrisis-monetary-policy-1507920906BOSTON—Stanford University economics professor       John Taylor,        a contender to become the next Federal Reserve chairman, Friday renewed his criticism that the central bank helped fuel the financial crisis by keeping interest rates too low.Fed “policy did seem to go off track” in the early to mid-2000s, causing the economy to overheat, Mr. Taylor said at a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.President       Donald Trump       met Wednesday with Mr. Taylor, one of four candidates to lead the Fed when       Janet Yellen’s       term as chairwoman expires in February. Ms. Yellen is among the final contenders, along with Fed governor       Jerome Powell       and former governor       Kevin Warsh.      Mr. Taylor declined to comment on his candidacy.Speaking on a panel at the Boston conference, he repeated his longtime argument in favor of basing Fed interest-rate policy on established rules. He is best known for creating the “Taylor Rule,” a mathematical formula for setting rates based on various economic variables, such as growth, inflation and labor-market conditions.A Cleveland Fed tool estimates that the 1993 version of the Taylor Rule would have put the Fed’s benchmark federal-funds rate around 2.5% in the third quarter, well above its current range between 1% and 1.25%. If Mr. Taylor became Fed chairman and sought to raise rates much higher, he could run into resistance from other Fed officials who support the current policy.Mr. Taylor said Friday that legislation pushed by House Republicans to require the Fed to follow a formal rule would help avoid a repeat of the kind of policy mistakes he says led to the financial crisis. He said rules “are meant to help policy makers make better decisions and operate in a democracy” with a better level of accountability for their actions. Fed officials, including Ms. Yellen, oppose the bill, saying it would limit their flexibility.Mr. Taylor’s views generated pushback from participants at the conference. Speaking before the Stanford professor’s presentation, Boston Fed President       Eric Rosengren       said a formal rule imposed by Congress that is inflexible “could lead to large policy mistakes.”Mr. Rosengren pointed to an example of where the Taylor Rule would have led the central bank astray. “In 2007, the actual federal-funds rate decreased much sooner than would have been implied by the 1993 Taylor Rule,” Mr. Rosengren said. “In the case of 2007, a much slower reaction to the impending financial problems would have exacerbated what was already a very serious economic downturn.”“From my perspective, policy effectiveness will be better served, instead, by a more robust formulation of monetary policy that draws on a diverse set of guidelines and benchmarks—which is the exercise Fed policy makers conduct every six weeks for actual [Federal Open Market Committee] meetings,” he said.Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President       Robert Kaplan,        commenting from the audience, challenged Mr. Taylor by arguing the much more important blunder during the run-up to the financial crisis was a breakdown in bank supervision and regulation. For him, low rates weren’t the prime mover of the troubles.Two former Fed officials who served during the crisis years also took issue with Mr. Taylor. Columbia University professor       Frederic Mishkin,        who was a governor between 2006 and 2008, agreed with Mr. Kaplan’s critique, though he acknowledged he would have preferred higher short-term rates during that period.And if there was a monetary policy mistake then, former Fed Vice Chairman       Donald Kohn       said it might have been in the too predictable pace of rate rises, not in the absolute level of rates themselves.Mr. Kohn also that during the period Mr. Taylor identifies as exhibiting rulelike behavior—the academic pegs this happening between 1985 and 2003—officials didn’t discuss rules at all when setting rates.Mr. Kohn said Taylor-like rules, slavishly followed, would have created problems during the recovery. “If we had been following rules over the last several years, the outcomes would be worse,” with potentially lower inflation and higher unemployment.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/veteran-affairs-head-interviews-for-health-and-human-services-post-1507938721       David Shulkin,        the current U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs and a holdover from the Obama administration, has been interviewed by the White House for the top job at Health and Human Services, according to sources familiar with the meetings.He is one of a number of leading contenders for the position, which has been vacant since late September when former HHS Secretary       Tom Price       resigned over criticism of his use of private and military planes.Other potential candidates include       Seema Verma,        the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to a White House official. Others who also may be in the running are former Pennsylvania Sen.       Rick Santorum,        former Louisiana Gov.       Bobby Jindal,        New Jersey Gov.       Chris Christie       and       John Fleming,        currently HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for health technology reform.Representatives from multiple veteran advocacy groups said rumors of Dr. Shulkin’s interest in switching agencies has been known among some in the community. A VA spokeswoman would neither confirm nor deny Dr. Shulkin’s interview, and a spokesman referred all questions about cabinet-level positions to the White House.The White House official said that Dr. Shulkin has “made his case” for becoming the next department secretary. Working against him might be the success he has had at the VA, this person said. Both Dr. Shulkin and Ms. Verma have done well in their present positions—a reason President       Donald Trump       may have no wish to move them, the official said.“Sometimes you promote someone who’s doing a great job,” the official said. “On the other hand, these are two highly functioning, effective officials doing a good job where they are. And they’re very little trouble.”Dr. Shulkin, a physician, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for his current position and has extensive experience in health-care management.He is a holdover from former President       Barack Obama’s       administration, and was first appointed by Mr. Obama to be the head of the VA’s health-care arm under then-Secretary       Robert McDonald.       He served in that role for more than a year before being tapped for the top job at the department by Mr. Trump.The White House interview indicates Mr. Trump may be moving quickly to fill the position as he undertakes a sweeping administrative effort to roll back the Affordable Care Act. The position oversees a $1 trillion agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid and implementation of the health law.Dr. Shulkin’s short tenure has helped push through a number of popular measures including expanding the GI Bill and employee-accountability measures, which have drawn bipartisan praise in Congress and from influential veteran advocacy groups.While lawmakers from both parties have lauded Dr. Shulkin’s overall performance, he has also drawn some criticism from the VA’s major union and from some veterans groups that say he has put too much focus on punishing workers and moved the department toward more use of private-sector doctors. He also recently has been ensnared in questions about his official travel, prompting the department’s inspector general to look into the matter.Legislators and veterans groups also await his promised unveiling of plans to address the department’s use of private-sector care. It could lead to a fight in Congress over the department’s future and whether it will move toward more private-sector reliance.Before joining the VA, Dr. Shulkin served in a variety of executive roles in private hospital systems, including as chief executive of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-collins-to-remain-in-u-s-senate-1507900816Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, a centrist Republican who has been a decisive vote in thwarting some of President       Donald Trump’s       legislative agenda, on Friday ended months of speculation and said she would not quit the Senate to run for governor.Ms. Collins seriously considered running for governor in 2018 to succeed two-term Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who is barred from running for another term, instead of finishing her Senate term, which ends in 2020.“I realized how much remains to be done in a divided and troubled Washington if we are to serve the people of our states,” she said in announcing her decision to a business group in Rockport, Maine. “I am a congenital optimist, and I continue to believe that Congress can—and will—be more productive.”Her decision was a relief to many of her Senate colleagues, who see her as an important bridge builder in a polarized Senate, and to Republicans who worried that her seat would have been be hard for the party to hold in 2020 if she left.But her decision to stay may not be so welcome to Trump supporters and conservatives. Ms. Collins has been a vocal Trump critic and a thorn in the side of GOP leaders. She cast one of the deciding votes that killed GOP legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.She is very popular in Maine, having won re-election to the Senate in 2014 with 68% of the vote.But running for governor wouldn’t have been a cakewalk. She faces animosity from Mr. LePage, who has criticized her for voting against the GOP health-care bill. And she would have faced a primary fight against more conservative members of the GOP, including LePage protégé Mary Mayhew, former Maine health commissioner.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-disclose-what-groups-were-targets-of-russia-backed-election-ads-1507819693Facebook Inc.        FB 1.17%       will publicly disclose the types of people targeted by Russian-backed ads during and after the 2016 presidential election, operating chief       Sheryl Sandberg       said.In an interview Thursday with Axios, Ms. Sandberg acknowledged Facebook’s platform was manipulated in a way it shouldn’t have been during the election. She said the company was cooperating with Congress and planned to share with investigators more information about Russia-linked activity on the social network.Facebook last month said it had identified 470 “inauthentic” Russian-backed accounts tied to one pro-Kremlin company that was responsible for $100,000 in ad spending on the company’s platform. Those ads reached an estimated 10 million people.The targeting information will reveal what kinds of American voters Russians aimed to reach. Facebook enables ads to be targeted by race, ethnicity, location and other characteristics.Those who have seen the Facebook ads describe them as being intended to sow chaos. But Ms. Sandberg stressed that had the ads been purchased by legitimate accounts, Facebook would have allowed them to run. “We don’t check the information people put on Facebook before they run it and I don’t think anybody should want us to do that,” Ms. Sandberg said. Facebook is sharing information about its findings with other tech companies, she said. The company also is investing in machine learning to detect the kind of fake accounts that bought divisive ads and spread fake news during the election. Facebook already has shared advertisements with Congress. On Thursday, Ms. Sandberg said the company also was willing to hand over free posts shared by those accounts, which would have reached far more users than the ads.“We’re going to give them the material they want,” she said.Congress is investigating foreign interference in the 2016 election, including efforts to back       Donald Trump       and oppose his Democratic rival,       Hillary Clinton.      On Wednesday, House lawmakers leading an investigation into Russian involvement in the presidential race said they would release the Facebook ads publicly. Facebook will help to scrub user information from the ads before their release.Ms. Sandberg spent back-to-back days on Capitol Hill this week addressing some of Facebook’s challenges in Washington. On Wednesday, she met with leaders of the House Intelligence Committee. On Thursday, she and a team of several Facebook executives sat down with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of 49 black lawmakers. In the Thursday meeting, Ms. Sandberg promised lawmakers that Facebook would do more to combat foreign influence on the platform, including committing additional staff and improving automated software to address fake content and foreign propaganda, according to lawmakers in the meeting. According to lawmakers, the meeting also featured a frank discussion on what lines Facebook has established around hateful or divisive political or social content. Several Russian ads contained content aimed at inflaming racial, religious or other social divisions within American society. “The meeting was a positive step in the right direction but these concerns around foreign interference in our election and fanning the flames of racial hatred are existential threats to our democracy,” said Rep.       Hakeem Jeffries,        a New York Democrat who was in the meeting. “It will take more than a singular meeting to resolve these challenges but Facebook does appear to be authentically committed to continuing to work with the Congress.” —Byron Tau contributed to this article.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/obamas-choose-rising-stars-to-paint-their-official-portraits-1507905689The Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery has commissioned a pair of rising-star artists—New York’s Kehinde Wiley and Baltimore’s Amy Sherald—to paint its official portraits of the former president and first lady.Both artists have exhibited widely, but this presidential assignmentamounts to a coup as they follow in the footsteps of artists like Gilbert Stuart, whose portraits of George Washington are considered masterpieces. The Obamas also made a point to champion the arts during their time in the White House, which has heightened art-world curiosity over which artists they would choose.The Smithsonian confirmed Thursday that former President Barack Obama has asked to be painted by Mr. Wiley, a 40-year-old artist who has an art degree from Yale University and is best known for his vivid portraits of young, black men in imperious, Old-Master poses.Mr. Wiley often depicts his subjects wearing hip-hop attire like hoodies and baggy, blue jeans and arranges them in postures once reserved for European aristocrats—a juxtaposition that helps the artist explore potent issues of race, class and power. Three years ago,             Sotheby’s                   sold Mr. Wiley’s 2006 double portrait of a pair of men in tank tops, “Charles I and Henrietta Maria (after Anthony Van Dyck),” for $143,000. The Brooklyn Museum and other institutions have also shown and collected his work.Ms. Sherald, a 44-year-old artist known for painting surreal portraits of elegant black women, will paint Ms. Obama. Ms. Sherald’s signature style is to use a palette of grays instead of skin tones to capture her subjects’ faces and hands. Her greyscale women are typically dressed in bright patterns and set against solid swaths of saturated color, a combination that looks like paper dolls or silhouettes from vintage photographs have been set atop children’s construction paper.Ms. Sherald, who studied painting at Georgia’s Clark-Atlanta University, is newer to the international art scene and hasn’t seen her work head to auction yet. Last year she won a national painting competition at the Portrait Gallery. Her winning piece, “Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance),” showed a young woman in a navy, polka-dot dress and white gloves, sipping from an oversized tea cup and staring defiantly. She also has a piece in the Smithsonian’s new National Museum of African American History and Culture.A spokeswoman for the National Portrait Gallery said she couldn’t disclose details about the Obama portraits until they are unveiled early next year, after which they’ll join the museum’s collection. Anticipation in art circles is high because the Obamas have chosen artists with major followings—unlike the relatively obscure artists Nelson Shanks and Ginny Stanford who were enlisted to paint former President       Bill Clinton       and his First Lady,       Hillary Clinton.       Currently, the museum has stored Mr. Shanks’ version and is exhibiting a loaned portrait of Mr. Clinton painted by better-known New York artist Chuck Close. Robert Anderson, another artist who is not that well known, painted his former college classmate, President       George W. Bush.       The portrait is hanging in the museum’s West Gallery. The Smithsonian’s set of presidential and first-lady portraits remains distinct from the White House’s own collection of portraits, though. It was the White House that first enlisted an African-American artist to paint a presidential portrait when it hired Simmie Knox, a self-taught artist from Alabama, in 2000 to paint the Clintons.Mr. Wiley and Ms. Sherald are the first black artists hired by the Smithsonian to paint a president and his first lady. The Smithsonian said it plans to pay for the works via private donations.The artists, reached through their galleries, declined to speak about their respective portraits of the Obamas until they are unveiled.Collector Joy Simmons, who is known for her collection of contemporary African-American artists, said the artist, who often hires painting assistants, told her he plans to handle all the brushwork this time around.Ms. Simmons, who owns a watercolor by Mr. Wiley, said that Ms. Sherald’s profile should get a particular boost from the commission. “I’ve been coveting one of her works,” she added, “but I’m way down the waiting list. Now, that list will get even longer.” Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com       Appeared in the October 16, 2017, print edition as 'the obamas pick portrait artists.'    –– ADVERTISEMENT ––Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald will paint the former president and first lady for the Smithsonian’s National Portrait GalleryAn error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toSubscribe NowSign InWSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMoreAccess provided to WSJ.com for up to {{passDuration}} on this device only, provided you do not clear your cookies.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mnuchin-says-parts-of-tax-plan-would-be-temporary-1507903361WASHINGTON—Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said Friday that some parts of a Republican plan to overhaul the tax code could be permanent while others would be temporary.Mr. Mnuchin, speaking at a conference of international bankers, also said he expects Congress can have a bill to the president’s desk by the beginning of December, an aggressive timeline.“There’s tax cuts that absolutely have to be permanent,” he said when asked whether the administration will be able to make tax cuts permanent. For example, moving to a territorial tax system, which would allow companies to repatriate their future foreign profits without paying U.S. taxes, would be very difficult to unwind, he said.On the other hand, the current GOP proposal includes a provision that would allow businesses to immediately write off investments for at least five years with little certainty beyond that.“That’s to incent people to invest money now and it’s a lot cheaper than giving it to them for 10 years,” Mr. Mnuchin said.That is cheaper for the federal budget in the short run, but would do much less to improve the economy, according to the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. In an analysis earlier this month, the group estimated that temporary investment writeoffs would lead to less than one-quarter of the economic growth of the full and permanent provision that House Republicans had proposed last year.The size of tax cuts, and the extent to which they are made permanent, will be constrained by Senate rules that limit the ability of Republicans to increase budget deficits. Those rules apply under the fast-track procedure that will let the GOP pass a tax plan without any Democratic votes.The party faces the challenge of fitting its tax goals—more than $5 trillion of rate cuts over a decade—into a budget plan that will likely allow for $1.5 trillion in bigger deficits over a decade and no additional deficits beyond that 10-year window. Doing so would require eliminating or shrinking some cherished tax breaks and could force the GOP to make some tax breaks temporary, even if they plan on coming back later to extend them.In 2001 and 2003 under President       George W. Bush,        Congress cut individual taxes and set a 2010 sunset date. Most of those cuts were extended permanently in 2013 by large bipartisan majorities and President       Barack Obama.      That would be tougher to do this time around, because Republicans want to make business tax cuts permanent up front, to provide companies with certainty for decision-making.A combination of permanent business tax cuts with temporary individual changes could be hard to sell to lawmakers and to voters. Republicans will likely consider pairing a permanent territorial tax system for businesses with a permanently higher standard deduction or child tax credit for individuals, said Rohit Kumar, a leader of PwC’s Washington National Tax Services. “You want, at least, to have something of similar quality be made permanent on the individual side,” said Mr. Kumar, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.)Mr. Mnuchin and other Trump administration officials have maintained the plan will generate enough economic growth to offset the costs of tax cuts, and may even reduce the deficit, a claim some tax analysts have said is very unlikely. Congressional Republicans’ schedule isn’t quite as aggressive as Mr. Mnuchin’s. The Senate is set to adopt its budget as soon as next week. Then, the House and Senate must agree on a budget.After that, the House Ways and Means Committee plans to release a detailed bill. House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) said this week that he hopes the House will vote on a tax bill in November and said he would keep lawmakers in Washington until Christmas, if needed, to work through a final version with the Senate.Republican Sens.       David Perdue       of Georgia and Tim Scott of South Carolina told major donors, including billionaire       David Koch,        on Friday in New York that the effort to overhaul the tax code is proving slower than expected. The donors are part of a network of political and policy groups steered by the Koch brothers. “I’m very concerned,” Mr. Perdue said about the ability to complete a tax bill on a timeline that has already slipped from November to December. “We have a ways to go yet, mainly on deductions. And mainly on the individual side.”Both acknowledged the efforts are concentrated on swaying “three or four” Senate Republicans and then reconciling the Senate and House plans. “Believing that we’re going to get this done by Thanksgiving is unrealistic,” Mr. Scott said. “By the time we get this issue, we’ll probably be bleeding into middle of December, and we’re going to use the backstop of Christmas, end of the year, to finish the process.”—Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-hackers-scanned-networks-world-wide-for-secret-u-s-data-1507743874WASHINGTON—The Russian government used a popular antivirus software to secretly scan computers around the world for classified U.S. government documents and top-secret information, modifying the program to turn it into an espionage tool, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.The software, made by the Moscow-based company Kaspersky Lab, routinely scans files of computers on which it is installed looking for viruses and other malicious software. But in an adjustment to its normal operations that the officials say could only have been made with the company’s knowledge, the program searched for terms as broad as “top secret,” which may be written on classified government documents, as well as the classified code names of U.S. government programs, these people said. Capital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Russian hackers used Kaspersky’s software in 2015 to target a contractor working for the National Security Agency, who had removed classified materials from his workplace and put them on his home computer, which was running the program. The hackers stole highly classified information on how the NSA conducts espionage and protects against incursions by other countries, said people familiar with the matter. An NSA spokesman didn’t comment on the breach. But the use of the Kaspersky program to spy on the U.S. is broader and more pervasive than the operation against that one individual, whose name hasn’t been publicly released, current and former officials said.Kaspersky Lab, founded by an engineer trained at a KGB technical school, has long insisted that it doesn’t assist the Russian government with spying on other countries. But many U.S. officials now think the evidence the U.S. has collected shows the company is a witting partner, said people familiar with the matter.“There is no way, based on what the software was doing, that Kaspersky couldn’t have known about this,” said a former U.S. official with knowledge of information gleaned in 2015 about how the software was used to search for American secrets. He said the nature of the software is such that it would have had to be programmed to look for specific keywords, and Kaspersky’s employees likely would have known that was happening, this former official said. The company said in a statement Wednesday that “Kaspersky Lab was not involved in and does not possess any knowledge of the situation in question, and the company reiterates its willingness to work alongside U.S. authorities to address any concerns they may have about its products as well as its systems.” Representatives of the Russian government didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement last week in response to the earlier Journal story, a Kremlin spokesman didn’t address whether the Russian government stole NSA materials using Kaspersky software. A spokesman for the NSA declined to comment, as did a White House spokesman. It remains unclear exactly how many other government computers or employees may have been targeted using the Kaspersky product or whether secret government material was stolen, said the people familiar with the matter.After discovering the 2015 breach, U.S. officials began gathering other evidence that Kaspersky was being used to identify classified information and assist in its theft, said the people familiar with the matter.For many months, U.S. intelligence agencies studied the software and even set up controlled experiments to see if they could trigger Kaspersky’s software into believing it had found classified materials on a computer being monitored by U.S. spies, these people said. Those experiments persuaded officials that Kaspersky was being used to detect classified information. The government of Israel first alerted the U.S. that Kaspersky software was being used to find American intelligence information, after Israel’s own computer spies penetrated the networks of Kaspersky Lab beginning in 2014, the current and former officials said.Once inside, the Israelis discovered how the software was being used and how Russia had obtained classified information from the NSA, these current and former officials said.Israel’s spying on Kaspersky, which U.S. officials said provided crucial evidence that Kaspersky Lab was working with the Russian government, and the use of Kaspersky to scan for classified keywords was first reported Tuesday by the New York Times. Israeli officials didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.After the Israelis passed along what they knew to the U.S., officials at the NSA began an investigation that led to the contractor who had installed Kaspersky software on his personal computer at home. People familiar with that investigation say he appeared to have no ill intent, but knew that removing the classified material from the NSA’s headquarters campus at Fort Meade, Md., was a violation of agency rules and possibly a crime.Last month, the Department of Homeland Security took the extraordinary step of banning all federal government agencies and departments from using Kaspersky goods and services. That action was a direct result of U.S. efforts to build a case against Kaspersky, said former officials involved in the work.Until that decision was made, Kaspersky software was authorized for use in 22 government agencies, U.S. officials have said. It also is sold to U.S. consumers and companies.“This new report further underscores the overwhelming case against Kaspersky Lab,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), who has redoubled her efforts in recent days to force the Trump administration to explain the damage the use of Kaspersky in government computers may have had. “These revelations should expedite efforts at the federal level to rid all federal infrastructure of Kaspersky Lab products.” Ms. Shaheen reiterated her request for the Senate Armed Services Committee to hold a hearing on the “vulnerability to our national security.” In a twist, Kaspersky appears to have known, or at least suspected, that it had been hacked by Israel. In June 2015, the company published a detailed technical analysis about malicious computer code used to break into its systems, which it dubbed Duqu 2.0. Experts believe that the original Duqu malware, on which the one inside Kaspersky’s system appears to have been based, was used to spy on officials participating in international negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, a fact that Kaspersky acknowledged in its paper.The Journal reported in 2015 that Israel had spied on closed-door talks among the U.S. and other world powers about curtailing Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Israeli officials denied spying directly on U.S. negotiators and said they received their information through other means, including close surveillance of Iranian leaders receiving the latest U.S. and European offers. In its paper, Kaspersky Lab also noted the original Duqu’s technical and design links to an earlier, more famous malware known as Stuxnet, which was developed by the U.S. and Israel to disrupt Iran’s nuclear program. The Kaspersky paper didn’t explicitly name Israel as the country that had penetrated the company, but people with knowledge of the operation confirmed that the company’s public technical analysis is referring to it.Kaspersky Lab said in a statement that it “was not the only target” of the malware and “we are confident that we have identified and removed all of the infections that happened during that incident. Furthermore, Kaspersky Lab publicly reported the attack, and the company offered its assistance to affected or interested organizations to help mitigate this threat.”  Write to Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.com and Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com       Appeared in the October 12, 2017, print edition as 'Russia Modified Software to Spy.'

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-dismisses-case-on-trump-travel-ban-1507683733WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court is one step closer to sidestepping a decision on President       Donald Trump’s       expiring travel ban, even while lawsuits on a new version of the ban move forward.The high court late Tuesday dismissed one of two pending cases on Mr. Trump’s executive order from March that barred travel to the U.S. by people from six Muslim majority countries. The president said the ban was needed for national security, while his critics said the prohibition unlawfully targeted people because of their religion.The justices, in a two-paragraph order, said the case was moot because the old six-country ban expired. It was replaced by a new, third version of the travel ban the president issued Sept. 24 that focuses on nationals from eight countries, including the non-Muslim majority nations of North Korea and Venezuela.Lawsuits already are moving forward in lower courts challenging the new restrictions.As part of its dismissal, the Supreme Court vacated a May ruling by the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Va., that said the president’s last travel ban “drips with religious intolerance” and was likely unconstitutional.The high court said wiping out the lower court ruling was consistent with its established practices for cases that become moot. The court said it was taking no position on the legality of the travel ban.Justice       Sonia Sotomayor       dissented from the court’s decision to take the lower court ruling off the books.One additional case on the expiring travel ban remains pending at the Supreme Court, though the court could soon dismiss it, too. The second case is from Hawaii and raises additional legal questions about the order’s ban on refugees. That prohibition on refugees remains in place for another two weeks, so the Hawaii case isn’t moot yet.The Justice Department had urged the high court to dismiss the cases and toss out the lower court rulings, while challengers to the expiring travel ban wanted the court to go ahead and consider the legality of the president’s actions. At the very least, they wanted the lower court decisions to remain in place even if the justices decided the cases were moot.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-be-more-aggressive-in-seeking-encrypted-data-1507651438The Justice Department signaled Tuesday it intends to take a more aggressive posture in seeking access to encrypted information from technology companies, setting the stage for another round of clashes in the tug of war between privacy and public safety. Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       issued the warning in a speech in Annapolis, Md., saying that negotiating with technology companies hasn’t worked. “Warrant-proof encryption is not just a law enforcement problem,” Mr. Rosenstein said at a conference at the U.S. Naval Academy. “The public bears the cost. When our investigations of violent criminal organizations come to a halt because we cannot access a phone, even with a court order, lives may be lost.” Mr. Rosenstein didn’t say what precise steps the Justice Department or       Trump       administration would take. Measures could include seeking court orders to compel companies to cooperate or a push for legislation. A Justice Department official said no specific plans were in the works and Mr. Rosenstein’s speech was intended to spur public awareness and discussion of the issue because companies “have no incentive to address this on their own.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have long complained that when they obtain cellphones or other devices from criminal or terrorism suspects they cannot unlock them to access critical information even if they obtain a warrant.Technology companies have pushed back, saying they are obligated to protect customers’ privacy and that many demands from investigators aren’t technologically feasible.Mr. Rosenstein employed many of the same arguments as his predecessors in the Obama administration about the dangers of criminals and terrorists “going dark” by using encrypted communications and systems that cannot be accessed by authorities.He used a tough tone regarding the companies, saying they aren’t cooperating with U.S. officials and are taking steps that help foreign governments censor information, while collecting “increasing volumes” of personal information about their customers. In footnotes in his text, Mr. Rosenstein referred to incidents involving             Apple Inc.,Facebook Inc.       and             Amazon.com Inc.       The three companies didn’t respond to requests for comment.“American technology providers sell products and services in foreign markets where the governments have questionable human rights records and enforce laws affording them access to customer data, without American due process or legal protections,” Mr. Rosenstein said. “Surely those same companies and their engineers could help American law enforcement officers enforce court orders.”Tech companies argue that creating “back doors” to their systems, allowing law-enforcement officials access to data when they are investigating a crime or terrorist incident, could make their networks vulnerable to hackers. They say they are under enormous pressure from privacy-minded consumers to make their technology as impenetrable as possible.The debate briefly came to a head in February 2016, when the Justice Department under President       Barack Obama       filed a motion to force Apple to comply with a judicial order to unlock an encrypted phone used by a shooters in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack.But the government eventually backed down after the FBI paid a still-unidentified third party to unlock the device, so it no longer needed Apple’s help to do so.Despite that court action, the Justice Department has often taken a less confrontational approach in dealing with technology companies’ use of encryption, engaging in lengthy discussions in hopes of winning cooperation.Those talks haven't yielded agreements satisfactory to law enforcement leaders, and technology companies continue to be driven by competitive pressure to make their networks and devices ever more secure.That prompted Mr. Rosenstein to argue Tuesday that the government needs to step up its own pressure, though he left vague what that would entail.“Technology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,” Mr. Rosenstein said. “Competition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.”Mr. Rosenstein conceded that even if American technological giants created “responsible encryption,” it wouldn’t stop criminals from discovering new apps and platforms that couldn’t be penetrated.But echoing arguments by his Obama administration predecessors, Mr. Rosenstein said that “any progress in preserving access to communications methods used by most criminals and terrorists would be a major step forward.”—Tripp Mickle contributed to this article.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-face-big-financial-hit-after-trump-move-to-end-aca-subsidies-1507902956Several major insurers said they intend to provide health plans on the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges for the rest of this year and for 2018, despite a financial blow from President       Donald Trump’s       cancellation of federal cost-sharing payments.  The payments, which had been expected to total $7 billion this year, will be “discontinued immediately” because their continuation violates federal law, the Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday. Payments due to go out on Wednesday will be canceled, the administration said in a legal filing.The loss of payments will take a financial toll on insurers for the rest of 2017, but it would be difficult for companies to yank their plans from the health law’s marketplaces before the end of the year.For next year, insurers that sell exchange plans under the 2010 law known as Obamacare, including             Centene Corp.      , Health Care Service Corp., Florida Blue,             Molina Healthcare Inc.       and Medica, have generally been preparing for the federal money to evaporate. Many state regulators have granted companies extra rate increases to make up for the lost federal funding, which reimburses insurers for covering health-care costs of low-income enrollees.“The bottom line is that we anticipated this action in our filings and we are prepared,” said Medica, a nonprofit offering ACA exchange plans in states including Iowa and Nebraska. Medica said it didn’t plan to alter its 2017 offerings or its 2018 plans.In states that didn’t grant the extra rate increases, such as Maryland, the dynamic will be different. There, insurers may face steep potential losses next year and would likely seek further rate increases, even though their 2018 rates are supposed to be completed. Insurers have already signed contracts agreeing to sell ACA plans in 2018.       Jerry Dworak,        chief executive of Montana Health Co-op, said that when he learned of the Thursday-night decision by Mr. Trump’s administration, “I felt gut-shot.” The nonprofit insurer asked Montana regulators if it could refile its 2018 rates for ACA plans because the approved ones were based on the assumption the federal payments would continue. In a statement, the state’s insurance commissioner, Matt Rosendale, said the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the state that Montana insurers are “ineligible for a refiling of adjusted insurance rates.”A spokesman for the Montana regulator said the co-op couldn’t withdraw its 2018 exchange plans under state law. Mr. Dworak said if the insurer is forced to offer plans in Montana next year using the earlier-approved rates, the losses could push it into receivership. Caitlin Oakley, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that insurers in the “vast majority” of states that use the federal HealthCare.gov exchange assumed in their rate filings that the cost-sharing payments wouldn’t be made. Federal officials are “working on a case-by-case basis with those states where regulators explicitly required insurers to assume” the payments would be made, she said.The chief executive of Maryland’s biggest exchange insurer,       Chet Burrell       of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, said the company asked the state’s insurance regulator if it can refile its 2018 exchange rates. If the request is denied, the company’s projected loss on ACA plans next year could deepen by $50 million, on top of a $100 million loss it is already expecting, he said. “That’s a very serious consequence,” Mr. Burrell said.Still, CareFirst isn’t considering leaving the exchanges this year or next year. A spokesman for the Maryland regulator declined to comment.The two major groups representing health insurers, America’s Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said they opposed the move by Mr. Trump’s administration. “We need constructive solutions that increase consumer choice, lower consumer costs and stabilize local markets,” they said in a statement. “Terminating this critical program will do just the opposite.”The loss of the federal payments can hit insurers hard because of how the 2010 law is written. The law included subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles for those with the lowest incomes. Insurers effectively advance the money, ensuring that the enrollees are protected. Then, companies are supposed to be reimbursed by the government. If the federal money doesn’t flow, the law forces the insurers to keep covering low-income enrollees’ out-of-pocket charges anyway. That money comes out of the insurers’ own pockets.“We expect health plans still in the exchanges to have immediate losses, some of potentially large magnitude,” wrote analyst       Sheryl Skolnick       of Mizuho Securities in a note Friday morning. Among those potentially exposed, analysts wrote, are Centene,             Anthem Inc.       and Molina Healthcare, which all have substantial exchange footprints this year. Anthem didn’t respond to a request for comment.In a statement, Molina said, “at this point, Molina Healthcare plans to continue participation in all the states where we are currently offering marketplace plans for the rest of 2017 and the seven states where we filed for 2018, but we will continue to evaluate our participation on a market-by-market basis.”       Michael F. Neidorff,        chief executive of Centene, said, “based on the evaluation we have to date, it’s business as usual.” He said, “I don’t like to create bare areas.” In several markets, Centene is the only insurer offering ACA plans for next year. “We see it having a minimal impact, if any” on Centene, which has generally assumed in its 2018 rates that the payments would stop, he said.For 2017, there are a number of factors that would make it difficult for insurers to withdraw from the exchanges. Under the contract that many signed with the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, insurers do have the right to pull out if the cost-sharing payments cease. But other laws, both at the federal and state levels, may slow or block their exit, according to       Timothy S. Jost,        an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University. Generally, insurers are required to give 90 days’ notice to consumers if they are going to stop offering a product, among other requirements.Despite the financial risk of losing the cost-sharing payments, insurers may be reluctant to make so disruptive a move with only a few months remaining in their existing policies.“We honor our contracts,” said       Daniel J. Hilferty,        chief executive of Independence Blue Cross who said the insurer won’t pull out for 2017. For 2018, the company is talking to state regulators. “We will stay in the marketplace in 2018 if in fact they agree to rate structures that take into account that the government is not paying” cost-sharing reimbursements, he said.In many states, insurers agreed to participate for next year after months of discussions with regulators. It will be difficult for those insurers to now tell states that they won’t sell marketplace plans.“The president has been saying this for months, so everyone has understood it could happen at any moment,” said Gary Cohen, a vice president at Blue Shield of California, which won’t pull back its exchange plans this year or next, he said.Florida Blue said in a statement that it won’t seek to change its 2017 ACA plans and “will absorb the financial impact” of the lost federal payments. For next year, its rates were filed “assuming [cost-sharing reduction payments] would not be funded in 2018.”Health Care Service, which offers exchange plans in five states, said the Trump administration decision “does not impact our market participation.” Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com       Appeared in the October 14, 2017, print edition as 'Insurers Anticipated Subsidy Loss.'    –– ADVERTISEMENT ––Payments ‘will be discontinued immediately,’ but companies may have difficulty pulling plans from health exchangesAn error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toSubscribe NowSign InWSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMoreAccess provided to WSJ.com for up to {{passDuration}} on this device only, provided you do not clear your cookies.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/explaining-health-insurance-cost-sharing-reductions-1507905971The White House said it will stop making federal payments to insurers known as cost-sharing reductions, or CSRs. The payments go to insurers that offer plans on the Affordable Care Act’s health-insurance exchanges. Here is what you need to know. What are cost-sharing reductions? The payments are for subsidies that help people who buy health plans through the health law’s exchanges and whose income is between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level. The federal poverty level is around $12,000 for a single person. The subsidies reduce out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles for these people, potentially saving them thousands of dollars when they need health care. Under the ACA, the federal government is supposed to pay for the subsidies, at a cost estimated at $7 billion this year. Why are the payments such a big deal for insurers? The federal cost-sharing payments don’t go directly to the consumers who benefit from them. Instead, insurers effectively advance the money, making sure that people eligible for the subsidies don’t have to pay their full deductibles. Then, the insurers are supposed to be reimbursed by federal payments. But if the federal money doesn’t flow, the law forces the insurers to keep covering out-of-pocket charges on behalf of the low-income enrollees anyway. That money comes out of the insurers’ pockets and, companies say, could lead to severe financial losses. Will insurers immediately pull back their ACA exchange plans now that cost-sharing reduction payments are stopping? Since the payments stopped before the end of this year, insurers may try to immediately pull back their exchange plans to head off financial losses, but they face some barriers to doing so. Under the contract that many signed with the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, they have the right to pull out if the CSRs stop. But other laws, both at the federal and state level, may slow or block their exit, according to Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University. Generally, insurers are required to give 90 days notice to consumers if they are going to stop offering a product, among other requirements, though this requirement may not apply if the product is still being offered outside the ACA marketplace. Why is this an issue? The CSRs were the crux of a suit filed by House Republicans in 2014 that argued that lawmakers never appropriated funds for the payments, which thus shouldn’t have been made by the Obama administration. Last year, a federal judge agreed with the GOP lawmakers, saying the payments were improper. The effects of the ruling were stayed, and the payments continued, while the Obama administration appealed. What is happening on Capitol Hill? There is a possibility of a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would lock in the federal payments, but it is far from clear that such legislation can pass.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-poised-to-end-subsidies-to-health-insurers-1507865484The Trump administration will end billions of dollars in payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act program, but President Donald Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, according to people familiar with the matter on Capitol Hill and in the health-care industry.The White House in a statement Thursday night said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is no appropriation for the payments and the government can’t lawfully make the payments. The Department of Health and Human Services was even more direct, saying the payments “will be discontinued immediately” and citing a legal opinion from Attorney General Jeff Sessions.“We believe that the last Administration overstepped the legal boundaries drawn by our Constitution,” acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan and       Seema Verma,        administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a joint statement. “Congress has not appropriated money for [the payments], and we will discontinue these payments immediately.”Mr. Trump told at least one lawmaker Thursday that he is feeling pressure to end the payments, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, because they are the subject of a lawsuit, according to the people familiar with the matter. The administration is scheduled to update the court on the status of the case on Oct. 30.But, according to these people, Mr. Trump also told the lawmaker that he would support preserving the payments if a bipartisan deal being led by Sens.       Lamar Alexander       (R., Tenn.) and       Patty Murray       (D., Wash.) comes together. The senators have been working on legislation that would maintain the payments to insurers, which Democrats want, while also meeting a Republican goal of giving states more flexibility in how they implement the ACA.The White House had earlier suggested Mr. Trump wouldn’t sign such a deal, but his comments Thursday suggest he has changed his thinking.Democrats responded angrily to the announcement. “It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and House Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       (D., Calif.) in a joint statement. “Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.”The fate of the payments, which allow insurers to offset subsidies to low-income consumers, has been the subject of intense speculation among insurers and in the health-care industry more generally.Insurers have said they may exit the ACA exchanges, or marketplaces, in 2019 if the payments are discontinued, or possibly raise premiums further. The payments have been made on a month-to-month basis, with the next distribution expected around Oct. 21.A number of insurers have said they were worried that Mr. Trump would end the payments this month because a Republican effort in Congress to repeal much of the ACA and replace it with a more conservative approach recently collapsed.Mr. Trump’s interest in the bipartisan talks reflects his desire to make changes to health care that appeal to both parties, people familiar with his thinking said. The president has also reached out to Mr. Schumer about a bipartisan path forward on health care.A federal judge in 2016 ruled the cost-sharing payments were improper after House Republicans filed a lawsuit in 2014 to block them, arguing that they hadn’t been approved by Congress as necessary. The case has been in a holding pattern, with regular updates to the court every three months.Mr. Trump had warned the payments would be halted after Republicans in the Senate failed in their attempts to overturn the ACA.Thursday’s developments put further pressure on Democrats to make progress on the bipartisan talks, which some Republicans have also backed as a way to help shore up the individual insurance markets and give states more flexibility in the ACA’s implementation.A final deal on the bipartisan talks is close, according to some of those involved. Ms. Murray made a number of concessions requested by Republicans just before the last proposal to repeal the ACA was pulled.—Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-sign-order-to-expand-health-insurance-options-for-self-insured-1507410483WASHINGTON—President       Donald Trump       will sign an executive order next week to start lifting some insurance rules set by his predecessor’s Affordable Care Act in the aftermath of the failed Republican bid to repeal the law, a senior administration official said Saturday.The order is aimed at expanding insurance options for Americans who buy coverage on their own or work for a small employer, and would include broad instructions for agencies to explore ways to loosen regulations and potentially lower premiums, as well as looking at three specific areas of health insurance. It has been anticipated by industry officials and political observers in the days since the GOP repeal effort crashed.Republicans have long contended that the insurance rules set by the 2010 health law, popularly dubbed Obamacare, have driven up premiums in the individual and small group markets, for healthier Americans especially. Democrats and supporters of the law typically counter that the rules have protected consumers from unwittingly buying shoddy products and helped subsidize the costs of sicker Americans.Mr. Trump will order three agencies, the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, to take steps to make it easier for people to band together and buy insurance through “association health plans,” the official said.Such plans would in some ways be like large employer’s health plans, subject to some restrictions set by the Affordable Care Act, including a ban on lifetime limits. But they would be free of other regulations, including the requirement that insurance plans cover a set package of benefits. These plans are popular with conservatives; some insurers fear that associations would peel off healthier and younger individuals and leave traditional insurance plans to cover sicker and older customers.The president also will order the agencies to start winding back an Obama-era rule curbing coverage known as “short-term medical insurance,” a low-cost but limited-protection option, and allow people to once again buy those plans for up to a year, the official said.The Obama administration banned the sale of those plans that offered coverage for more than 90 days, arguing they were inadequate for people’s needs. Some industry officials have pressed the administration to restore them, saying that when marketed honestly they can fit the needs of particular consumers currently priced out of buying the more generous coverage available as a result of the 2010 health-care overhaul.In addition, the executive order would order agencies to expand health reimbursement accounts, employer-funded arrangements that employees can use to pay out-of-pocket medical costs and premiums. Obama-era guidance from 2013 had prevented pretax employer dollars in the arrangements from being used to buy health insurance on the individual market.The three moves would represent the most substantive step the White House has taken to date in paring back Affordable Care Act rules using administrative powers. They don’t go as far as many critics of the law would like but are likely to be followed by other steps, administration officials said.At the same time, Mr. Trump has signaled that he is interested in working with Democrats to pass a bipartisan health-care deal, and Democrats have responded by proposing their own preferred measures to shore up rickety health-insurance markets, in which rising premiums have hit many of the same people targeted by the executive order.Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday morning that he had spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) a day earlier to discuss renewing efforts to pass health-care legislation.Later Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters as he traveled to North Carolina that he was willing to cut a short-term deal with Democrats to save the health law from collapsing, but “it’s really up to them. [The Affordable Care Act is] exploding, like I said it would.”But parts of the order may prove contentious enough to undo that effort—chiefly, its directive to the Labor Department to spur the sale of insurance across state lines through the use of association health plans. Health analysts and industry officials also said some of the regulatory changes, once completed, could prompt legal challenges. The department would likely make changes that effectively expand the scope of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, which governs the plans operated by large employers with workers in different states. Ahead of the release of the rule, the department had already been examining the law, according to people familiar with the deliberations. In addition, the Treasury Department has been exploring changes to the rules governing health-reimbursement accounts, industry officials said. The idea of coverage sold across state lines has long been championed by Republicans, who say it is the most effective way to foster competition, particularly in parts of the country where people buying coverage on their own currently have only one insurer selling plans. A spokesman for Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.), said he had been pushing the idea with the administration. “He has been working with President Donald Trump on this proposal for several months, and we believe it will directly result in giving the American people more options to find low-cost and high-quality health care options,” said Sergio Gor, the spokesman. Democrats have characterized the effort as potentially sabotaging the consumer protections they set in the ACA, and they have won support from some insurance industry officials. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has said it has concerns.Some industry officials say that siphoning off healthier individuals from the existing insurance markets with the promise of skimpier benefits but lower premiums could further undermine those markets, increasing premiums ever more for the sicker, costlier enrollees that remain.“Its aim is clearly to do with the pen what Congress wouldn’t—eliminate pre-existing condition protections, essential benefit protections and lifetime caps and turn the ACA into a sparsely available high-risk pool,” said       Andy Slavitt,        who was the Obama administration’s top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Mr. Trump pledged he would issue the order the day after Senate Republicans decided last month that they didn’t have enough support to pass a repeal proposal led by Sens.       Lindsey Graham       of South Carolina and       Bill Cassidy       of Louisiana, ending GOP efforts for now to roll back the ACA. “It’s being finished now,” Mr. Trump said last month. “It’s going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people. Millions of people.” Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com, Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.comExecutive action expected next week would roll back some Obamacare requirements An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toSubscribe NowSign InWSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMoreAccess provided to WSJ.com for up to {{passDuration}} on this device only, provided you do not clear your cookies.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-touts-tax-plans-benefits-for-households-1507766110President       Donald Trump       said Wednesday that average U.S. households could save $4,000 on their taxes if Congress approves his plan to overhaul the federal tax code, the first such estimate the White House has attached to its proposal.Speaking in Harrisburg, Pa., Mr. Trump said those savings would result from his call to lower tax rates on individuals and on companies that have parked some profits overseas. He attributed that estimate to the Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that is expected to release a fuller estimate of Mr. Trump’s tax plan by next week.Standing in front of an 18-wheeler, Mr. Trump promised to make paying taxes simpler for most Americans, and again vowed to deliver major cuts for the middle class. He also said his tax plan would help spark the economy.“American trucks will glide along our highways—so beautiful will those highways be: smooth, beautiful, no potholes,” he said to cheers. “I know, no potholes. I have many friends in the trucking business and they tell me it’s never been like this…They will be beautiful again—they will be smooth, beautiful highways again.”He warned Congress to quickly approve legislation. “You better get it passed,” he told lawmakers.His speech came at the end of a day in which the president sought to knock down a report that he wanted a 10-fold increase in the nation’s nuclear arsenal, saying such a move was “totally unnecessary” and lashed out at NBC News, which reported the story.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/espn-should-eschew-politics-cover-sports-1506272932I love Jason Gay’s colorful and humorous horror-flick analogy in “Television: The Great ESPN Pile-On” (Sports, Sept. 18), but let’s deal with consequences and inconsistencies. Curt Schilling, a conservative ESPN sports analyst, made a series of inappropriate comments directed toward candidate       Hillary Clinton       and the transgender community and was fired in April 2016. At the time ESPN called itself an inclusive company, and said, “Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated.” Jemele Hill described President Trump as a white supremacist and a bigot, and yet she remains an ESPN employee today. I am not a Trump supporter, but I have been a (non-blood-lusting) human-resources professional for 39 years, and I feel strongly that there should be a level playing field where a company’s policies are inclusive and applied equally to all employees. Mr. Gay and ESPN missed the call. Michael Moskowitz  Carlsbad, Calif. –– ADVERTISEMENT ––As a political independent who voted for       Bill Clinton       and       Barack Obama,        I’ve cut the cord with ESPN not because it covers political issues as they relate to sport, but because that coverage is exclusively an echo chamber for the progressive left. Controversial subjects are seemingly always characterized as examples of racism. There is no fact checking or investigation, and certainly no conservative perspective for consideration. Superficial and racially charged commentary is Jemele Hill’s calling card, but she is hardly alone at the network. There may be other and better reasons for ESPN’s decline in viewership, but my reason is its liberal bias. Dean Scarafoni  Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-takes-on-the-partisan-gerrymander-1507023002WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday confronted the hard-edged politics of electoral redistricting, with justices divided over whether judicial intervention to stop extreme gerrymanders posed a greater threat to democracy than allowing legislative majorities to manipulate precinct maps to their advantage.“If you can stack a legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote?” said Justice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg,        a liberal who has long viewed partisan gerrymanders as a blot on the Constitution. The map at issue, drawn by Wisconsin Republicans after the 2010 census, eliminates competitive districts and “preordains” results in most of the state, she said.–– ADVERTISEMENT ––But Chief Justice John Roberts, noting the Supreme Court’s obligation to hear most election appeals, said a loss for Wisconsin would prompt a torrent of gerrymandering claims nationally, infecting the judiciary with a political taint it strives to avoid.“We will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win,” the chief justice said, reflecting conservative justices’ longstanding reluctance to tinker with legislative mapmaking. “That is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country.”The rhetoric reflected the potential sweep of a case nationwide for the political remap that will follow the 2020 census, and much of it was aimed squarely at Justice       Anthony Kennedy.      In a 2004 case, when four liberals asserted that partisan gerrymanders were unconstitutional and four conservatives contended such maps were unsuited to judicial review, Justice Kennedy said he would vote to strike down such lines—“if workable standards” could be found. Unfortunately for plaintiffs that year—Democrats challenging a GOP-drawn map in Pennsylvania—Justice Kennedy found their formula for evaluating and remedying gerrymandering claims inadequate.At issue now is how Republican lawmakers drew district maps for Wisconsin’s lower house after they won control of the Legislature and the governor’s mansion in 2010. It was the GOP’s first shot at drawing state districts in the state in more than 50 years, and they used it to great advantage.Deploying computer technology and voter data unavailable in previous decades, GOP mapmakers drew districts allowing them to retain a commanding assembly majority despite losing the popular vote in statewide 2012 legislative races. Republicans have picked up more seats in the years since, now holding 64 of 99. A special three-judge court in Madison, Wis., found in favor of the challengers in a divided ruling. The court’s majority ruled Republicans entrenched their own power and impeded the ability of Democrats “to translate their votes into legislative seats.”Wisconsin then appealed to the Supreme Court, creating Tuesday’s gerrymandering rematch. The lawyer whose argument fell short of persuading Justice Kennedy 13 years ago, Paul Smith, was back representing Wisconsin Democrats and presenting a formula he said would pass the test this time.“The social scientists stepped up and said, We have three different ways to calculate asymmetry,” said Mr. Smith, citing measures for gauging how unfairly a minority party was being treated.Wisconsin Solicitor General Misha Tseytlin said Mr. Smith’s test “would merely shift districting from elected public officials to federal courts, who would decide the fate of maps based upon battles of experts.” Chief Justice Roberts was more dismissive, calling the Smith approach “sociological gobbledygook.”But Justice       Elena Kagan       observed that legislators themselves use similar measurements to draw maps exploiting partisan advantage, and she said courts could do the same “to evaluate what they’re doing.”“This is not kind of hypothetical, airy-fairy, we guess, and then we guess again,” she said. “I mean, this is pretty scientific by this point.”The court has never found a partisan gerrymander unconstitutional, but it has struck down electoral districts because they are unequal in population or discriminate against minorities, principally based on the 14th Amendment’s equal-protection clause. Conservative justices suggested Wisconsin Democrats were seeking to stretch claims beyond previous 14th Amendment precedents.But as in 2004, Justice Kennedy said he was interested in exploring a different approach to the case—one that viewed gerrymanders not as undermining equality, but rather as an infringement of the First Amendment rights to speech and association by undermining a minority party’s voting strength. Justice Kennedy asked no questions of Mr. Smith, but twice during Wisconsin’s argument he returned to the First Amendment approach. “Suppose the court…decided that this is a First Amendment issue, not an equal protection issue. Would that change the calculus?” he asked Mr. Tseytlin.“Burdening or penalizing citizens because of their participation in the electoral process, their voting history, their association with a political party, or their expression of political views” generally is unconstitutional in other contexts, he wrote then.Justice       Samuel Alito      —whose father helped draw political maps as staff director of the New Jersey Legislature—agreed that “gerrymandering is distasteful.” But he said the social-science model for distinguishing permissible partisan influence from a constitutional violation, part of which derives from a 2014 scholarly article, was too new and speculative to be of use.“After 200 years, it’s been finally discovered in this paper by a young researcher!” Justice Alito said. “Is this the time for us to jump into this?”Justice       Sonia Sotomayor       had a different question.“Could you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering?” she asked Erin Murphy, a lawyer for the Wisconsin Legislature. “How does that help our system of government?”“It produces values in terms of accountability that are valuable, so that the people understand who isn’t and who is in power,” Ms. Murphy said.Because Republicans control more state legislatures after their nationwide gains in 2010, they have more to lose if the high court adopts first-ever partisan limits on redistricting. But Democrats also face allegations of gerrymandering, including in a case on Maryland’s congressional districts, which is on hold pending a ruling by the Supreme Court in the Wisconsin matter.A decision is expected by June.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/epa-to-withdraw-power-plant-rules-1507580639The Trump administration is formally withdrawing federal limits on carbon emissions at power plants, triggering the next stage of what is likely to be a yearslong fight over the government’s centerpiece regulation for slowing climate change.The move pushes forward on a central pledge of President Donald Trump: a rollback of       Obama      -era environmental rules he has criticized for harming businesses and coal miners in particular. And it pushes the federal government further away from any effort to combat global warming, following Mr. Trump’s June announcement that he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator       Scott Pruitt       announced in Kentucky that he would sign a proposal Tuesday to reverse the rules. The announcement, made at an event organized by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) in the coal-mining town of Hazard, Ky., confirmed what many had expected for weeks.“Repealing this Obama-era rule would close a chapter of regulatory overreach that set standards without regard to the steep costs or availability of technology necessary to meet them,”       Hal Quinn,        chief executive of the National Mining Association, said in a statement applauding the decision.Power-plant emissions are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, and President Barack Obama’s administration targeted them with limits outlined by the EPA’s Clean Power Plan in 2015. The Obama limits became central to the country’s ability to reduce emissions under the Paris accord.But Mr. Trump, who has called global warming a “hoax,” ordered a review of the Clean Power Plan in March. The EPA’s review called the plan a legal overreach, and both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt have said it is burdensome to U.S. companies, and an unfair punishment for the fossil-fuel businesses to the benefit of wind- and solar-power producers.“The past administration was unapologetic,” Mr. Pruitt said during Monday’s announcement. “They were using every bit of power, every bit of authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers in how we generate electricity in this country. And that’s wrong.”EPA’s assessment under Mr. Pruitt calls the plan an unlawful expansion of the agency’s authority under the Clean Air Act by holding power generators responsible for limiting emissions through control systems that work from outside of their sites, according to documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal last week.Eliminating that requirement would be in line with what many industry officials wanted. The American Petroleum Institute, the Washington lobbying group for U.S. oil and gas producers, called the Clean Power Plan flawed and said emissions were improving even without it. “Market forces and technological innovation have driven the increased use of natural gas which has brought great benefits to American consumers, workers, and the environment,”       Jack Gerard,        the group’s chief executive, said in a statement.Utility industry officials were reserving comment ahead of Mr. Pruitt’s formal signing of the withdrawal Tuesday. Mr. Pruitt’s decision was met with swift opposition from both states and environmental groups. New York’s attorney general said he will sue to stop the repeal and his California counterpart said he “will do everything in my power to defend the Clean Power Plan.”Environmental groups made similar promises and many experts have said they expect the Trump administration’s actions to lead to years of rule-making procedure and litigation.“The fight against this dangerous decision is only just beginning,” the Sierra Club said in a statement. “Trump can’t reverse our clean energy and climate progress with the stroke of a pen, and we’ll fight him and Scott Pruitt at the state and local level across America.”The administration’s rollback comes just months after the government’s group of top climate researchers reported evidence showing more clearly that climate change and extreme weather events are coming from human activity. Their draft “Climate Change Special Report” documents thousands of studies that show the hottest temperatures in 1,700 years, the fastest-rising seas in more than 2,000 years and a five- to 10-fold increase in U.S. coastal flooding since the 1960s.
