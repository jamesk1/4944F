"The charge was detailed in court documents unsealed on Friday. The document accuses Flynn of making ""materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements"" to law enforcement about a phone call he had with former Russian Ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.

Information about it was leaked to the media in January, after Trump’s inauguration.

I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,"" Flynn wrote in his resignation letter.After he stepped down, Flynn filed an updated foreign registration form which showed that he had not disclosed contacts and payments from foreign entities – specifically, the government of Turkey – while serving as Trump's campaign adviser from February 2016."
"It seems that with each passing day in America another name is added to the list of powerful males from the gilded world of entertainment and politics – from Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein to US Senator Al Franken – falling in disgrace amidst claims of sexual misconduct.Amidst this feverish atmosphere of political impropriety, however, there was scant media and political representation at the National Press Club this week, where a group of women who say President Bill Clinton assaulted them hoped to draw attention to the problem.Women victims of Bill Clinton, Al Franken arrive in DC for news conference demanding that Franken/Conyers resign. National Press wire (owned by Libs) refuse to publicize this event at Nat’l Press Club 10 AM Wed. #BlatantBias@MediaEqualizer@JackPosobiec@alexjonesshowsSponsored by the Media Equality Project, Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones and Leslie Millwee – just a sampling of the women who claim Clinton assaulted them – called on lawmakers accused of sexual misconduct to resign, including Franken and Michigan Congressman John Conyers, both Democrats.The Republicans too have felt the sting of the ongoing sexual-assault claims. GOP Alabama candidate Roy Moore is fighting for his political life ahead of next month’s special Senate election, following claims that he attempted to engage in sexual relations with a number of women when they were teenagers.During the press conference, the women demanded transparency from the Congressional Office of Compliance, which reportedly paid $100,000 in taxpayer funds to settle sexual harassment claims from at least two male employees who worked for disgraced former Congressman Eric Massa (D-New York).The story of payouts to harassed female staffers does not end there, however. The Office of Compliance stunned watchdog groups when it admitted to paying out more than $17 million over a period of two decades to settle workplace complaints in Congress.The 1995 Congressional Accountability Act gave the Office of Compliance the right to spend taxpayer dollars from the Department of Treasury to settle harassment claims with victims – who are required to sign non-disclosure agreements as a part of the terms of their financial settlements – in the halls of Congress.Melanie Morgan, a co-founder of Media Equalizer, which organized Wednesday’s event, expressed disappointment that there were not more journalists in the audience. She singled out NBC, which is struggling to contain the fallout after Matt Lauer, host of the Today Show, had his contract terminated for sexual misconduct.“Are any of you guys with NBC?” Morgan asked the small group of videographers in the room. “ABC, CNN, CBS, PBS?”Efforts to get some female Congress members to join the event also failed. Invitations were sent to a number of congressional leaders, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, (D-New York) and Diane Feinstein (D-California), and Representatives Jackie Speier, (D-California), Barbara Comstock (R-Virginia) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D- California). Another invitation was extended to Melanie Sloan, former head of the Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington (CREW). None of them made an appearance at the press conference.Against the backdrop of this ongoing national scandal, one female politician is attempting to use the fallout to promote her political campaign. Dana Nessel, who is in the running to be nominated as the Democratic candidate for Michigan’s attorney general, thinks the best course of action is to “elect women only.”“Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting? That would be the candidate who doesn’t have one,” she told WWJ’s Charlie Langton. “If you get more women in office, if you get more women in positions of authority, you’re less likely to have issues where someone is pulling out their penis at an inappropriate time in the workplace.”"
"The government of Niger has permitted the Pentagon to operate armed drones out of the country’s capital, Niamey, defense officials said on Thursday, according to the New York Times. The newspaper cited a memorandum of understanding signed earlier this week by the US African Command (AFRICOM) and the West African nation.The memorandum calls for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to be armed by the AFRICOM initially. The drones will eventually be re-deployed to a Nigerien air base in Agadez, along with 500 US troops.Previous media reports indicated that Niger had requested the deployment of armed US drones in a bid to wipe out Boko Haram and other jihadist groups operating on its border with Mali, but it was unknown that an agreement had been reached. Speaking to Reuters, an unnamed US official also said that permission for the use of armed drones had been granted earlier this week, but the capability had not yet been put to use.A spokeswoman for the Pentagon declined to disclose specific details of the drone deployment. “The government of Niger and the US stand firm in working together to prevent terrorist organizations from using the region as a safe haven. For operational security reasons, I will not comment on specific military authorities or permissions,” Major Audricia Harris said.“This operation supports the long-term strategic partnership between the United States and Niger, as well as the ongoing effort to counter violent extremism throughout the region,” the Defense Department said in an emailed response to the New York Times.In early November, Nigerien Defense Minister Kalla Mountari told Reuters in an interview that he “asked them some weeks ago to arm them [the drones] and use them as needed.” Asked if the US had accepted the request, he said: “Our enemies will find out.” The development would allow the US military to significantly expand its reach in West Africa. So far, American aircraft are flying missions against targets in Yemen, Somalia and Libya from its bases in Djibouti and southern Italy, according to the NYT.It also comes two months after a team of four US Green Berets were ambushed and killed in Niger. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US military officials requested to send an armed drone to provide air cover for the team, but it was stuck in the approval process going through the Pentagon, State Department and Nigerien government. The US is not the only nation seeking to deploy armed UAVs to Niger. France, which deployed some 4,000 troops to its former colonies Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger as part of anti-terrorism Operation Barkhane, is also looking at the possibility of having their US-built Reaper drones armed.“Beyond our borders, the enemy is more furtive, more mobile, disappears into the vast Sahel desert and dissimulates himself amidst the civilian population,” French Defense Minister Florence Parly said in September, according to Reuters.“Facing this, we cannot remain static. Our methods and equipment must adapt. It is with this in mind that I have decided to launch the process to arm our intelligence and surveillance drones.”The US military extensively used armed drones to conduct airstrikes in various hotspots in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa, causing civilian casualties in many cases. In Somalia, where American troops are targeting Al-Shaabab Islamic militants, there have been 30 drone strikes during 2017, which killed up to 208, including at least three civilians, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

"Trump is considering delivering a speech or issuing a statement in which he would announce Jerusalem’s recognition as the Israeli capital, on Wednesday, AP and Reuters report, citing White House officials familiar with the issue. However, the US president is also expected to once again delay his campaign promise concerning the relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.He is also likely to issue another six-month waiver on moving the embassy by Monday, thus continuing the policy of his predecessors, who were signing such waivers since 1995 to override a law requiring the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem.However, the officials also did not rule out that both decisions could eventually be changed by next week. At the same time, no official statements concerning the issue have been released by the White House. “We’ve nothing to announce,” a spokesperson with the White House National Security Council told Reuters.The Trump administration also said that no decisions concerning the embassy’s relocation have been made yet. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called earlier reports about Trump planning to order the relocation “premature.” The next day, the State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, also said that “no decision on this matter has been made yet.”However, Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that Trump is ""actively considering when and how"" to move the embassy, AP reports. The decision concerning the Jerusalem’s recognition as the Israeli capital was reportedly taken on Monday following Trump’s meeting with his top national security advisors, according to the officials, cited by AP.Trump vowed to move the US embassy to Jerusalem during his presidential election campaign. However, the move has been repeatedly postponed up to this moment. In June, Trump issued a waiver overriding the 1995 law requiring the relocation. However, he said at that time that he still favored the move.In October, the US president said he would like to halt the procedure of moving the embassy to support Washington’s peace proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the meantime, Israel has been actively urging the US to finally relocate its diplomatic mission.In May, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move would actually contribute to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process by “shattering the Palestinian fantasy that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel.” As for the Palestinian Authority, it vehemently opposes such a decision.In November 2016, Palestine's UN envoy went as far as to vow that the Palestinians would fire back and make life “miserable” for the White House if it indeed transfers the US embassy to Jerusalem. A survey conducted in April 2017 showed that two-thirds of Palestinians in the West Bank would not accept Israel’s official capital moving to Jerusalem, even if they were given their own independence.Israel has long insisted that Jerusalem is its capital, but all foreign embassies are located in Tel Aviv. The 1948 partition of Israel named Jerusalem an “international city” and most states have refused to guarantee that they will accept a new Israeli capital even as part of a negotiated solution. In April 2017, Moscow said it could only recognize West Jerusalem as Israel’s official capital if the eastern part of the city would become the capital of the Palestinian state."
"“It’s laughable. It’s laughable,” Tillerson said on Friday, when asked by reporters if Trump is planning to replace him with Pompeo. The rumor was first reported by the New York Times on Thursday, citing an anonymous sources in the White House.Tillerson’s comment came during an appearance at the State Department with Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. Al-Sarraj’s visit to Washington includes meetings with President Trump and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. Mattis also denied the reports about Tillerson on Thursday, saying, “I make nothing of it, there’s nothing to it.”While greeting Libyan Prime Minister, Secretary Tillerson is asked about rumors he would soon be fired by President Trump. He responds: ""It's laughable,"" pic.twitter.com/MOTLguHREJTrump himself denounced the report as ""fake news"" in a tweet on Friday afternoon.""He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!"" the president said.The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!https://t.co/FrqiPLFJ1EThe White House already denied the press reports on Thursday, though not quite as forcefully. When asked about it during a meeting with the Bahraini crown prince, Trump responded, “He’s here. Rex is here.”“When the president loses confidence in someone, they will no longer serve in the capacity that they’re in,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. “The president was here today with the secretary of state. They engaged in a foreign leader visit and are continuing to work together to close out what we’ve seen to be an incredible year.”In Washington, Tillerson is seen as a moderate in comparison to neoconservatives who aim to upend the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement with Iran. Pompeo has long opposed the Iran deal, dating back to his time in Congress.The US media have already ""fired"" Tillerson once before. In early October, NBC News reported that Vice President Mike Pence had to talk the secretary of state out of resigning, after Tillerson insulted Trump's intelligence during a midsummer meeting.Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil executive, dismissed the NBC report as ""petty nonsense"" and said he never considered resigning.Trump said at the time he had ""full confidence"" in Tillerson and branded the NBC report ""fake news, totally phony."""
"The decision was taken on Wednesday by a congressional committee citing the channel's new 'foreign agent' status. That's despite earlier assurances from the State Department that no restrictions would be imposed.RT asked George Galloway, broadcaster and former British MP, how the US Congress’ decision corresponds with the principle of free speech.George Galloway: It is monstrous. They are closing down free speech in the name of free speech. They are closing down freedom while posing as the champions of freedom. It is monstrous because it was a pack of lies – the statement… when they forced RT to register as a foreign agent, and then said that would not affect the RT employees doing their job, as reporters – only now to make it impossible for those reporters to perform their duties. It is part of this of this McCarthyite witch-hunt, which is most unbecoming for a country that claims to be a champion of freedom and democracy. If journalists in other countries, or for that matter in the US were true to their craft and to any ethic, which must underpin their craft, they would be condemning this in the broadest possible terms. But all I can hear is silence from British journalists and from American journalists.'What happens when you tell Americans 'you can’t do something?': Withdrawal of RT America’s accreditation on Capitol Hill ‘very dire development’ https://t.co/rg1dwcx9kMpic.twitter.com/dIGbKI8N3KI think will not be the last of these witch-hunting events, and the American public will be the poorer for it because RT had added to the tapestry of the journalism in the US, which frankly needed some additional color.RT:  When RT America was forced to register as a foreign agent, the State Department gave assurances the channel's news operations would not be affected. Why the sudden change?GG: So either fools, or knaves; either ignorant or willful – you can take your pick – it is a classic Catch-22 that Joseph Heller, the author of the greatest novel of the 20th century, would recognize. You make someone register as a foreign agent, and then you ban them because they are foreign agents. It is the ultimate Catch-22.Russian lower house to ban access to all US reporters – lawmaker https://t.co/mp8yEFSnhhRichard Black, Republican Virginia state senator, says that while the US talks about having a free press, it’s in fact heavily controlled.Richard Black:… The American news media have long been centrally controlled. While we talk about having a free press, it actually is quite heavily controlled, particularly in the area of foreign policy. What this decision does: number one, it tightens the media’s censorship over information that reaches the American public; secondly, it cuts competition by RT News to ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News.I don’t think it is any secret that RT News has had sort of an explosion of popularity with the American public because they feel that they can obtain news there that is censored from the mainstream media. Hopefully, RT News will be able to bypass this because the information that is received from RT News is absolutely vital to an informed public being able to make decisions.I would add that it is important to know that if you look at the letterhead on that letter from Congress, normally you’ll see a list of congressmen on the side of who are members of the committee. This is a very unusual committee because the Radio and Television Correspondents Gallery is an organization, which has no congressional representation and it is essentially controlled by ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News. So they are able to exclude competitors by saying: “Oh, well, you’re not longer admitted to the Gallery.”RT:  The International Federation of Journalists has called the move “covert censorship.” Do you agree?RB: It is absolutely censorship. I think censorship is the primary objective. Knocking out competition is a secondary objective… [Such information as, for example, about Libya, which is covered by RT] would not be shown on the mainstream media in the US, because it goes counter to the media narrative that somehow we rescued Libya from a tyrant.The fact is that we [US] destroyed a secular nonbelligerent country; we launched an aggressive war against them, and we left the nation in absolute shambles. And it is not surprising to see that France wants to attack Libya again because right now they risk losing their control over it to the tribes of Libya, who represent the people of Libya.So that is a report, that is just an example of the type of thing that would be censored by the US media, and RT News, fortunately, has given Americans a pick into the truth.RT:  When RT America was forced to register as a foreign agent, the State Department gave assurances its operations would not be affected. Why did they change the decision?RB: I am not sure that the press spokesman realized what was going on behind the scenes. The attorneys for the mainstream media understand the implications. This has been a step by step process, where first the Department of Justice took action; secondly, RT News was found to be a foreign agent. Then as a result of that, you have the situation, where now they’re de-credentialed.I doubt that the press spokesman recognizes that, but I will guarantee you that the attorneys for the mainstream media, who lobbied the Department of Justice, knew exactly what they were doing, and they had a three-step process.At the same time, we see efforts by YouTube and by Twitter to censor RT News. The fact is that the truth that is being revealed by RT News to the American public is undermining the ability of the military-industrial complex to wage these wars in foreign countries. Public support just continues to dip lower and lower for waging war all over the world, which is what we [the US] are doing right now."
"The Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a political witch hunt known as ‘Russiagate’, which has been the main obsession in Washington since even before Trump’s inauguration. It should therefore come as no surprise that many young Americans are expressing hope for change.Some 71 percent of Millennials – the generation of Americans born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s – say the Democratic and Republican parties are failing to such a degree at the primary task of representing the American people that a third major party is needed. That’s according to a recent NBC News/GenForward poll.Across the political landscape, neither major party scored particularly well in the poll. Although the Republicans under President Donald Trump appeared to fare worse.A full 63 percent of those polled say they disapprove of the way Trump is performing as president, while 60 percent held an unfavorable opinion of the way Congress is doing its job. Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed expressed an unfavorable view of the Republican Party, while 42 percent viewed the Democrats unfavorably.Those results support the findings of an earlier poll, sponsored by CNN and conducted by SSRS, which showed Americans losing faith in both major parties. Fifty-four percent of Americans polled said they hold an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party – its worst ranking in over 25 years, while 61 percent held an unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party.When the poll is broken down demographically, White millennials registered the highest percentage (75 percent) of those wanting a third-party choice. Other racial groups, however, were close behind. African Americans (69 percent), Asian Americans (69 percent) and Latinos (64 percent) all agreed that political choice in the United States is wanting.Broken down by sex, 74 percent of men believe the country needs a third party, while just 23 percent said the Republican and Democratic parties are effectively representing the needs of their constituents. On the other hand, 69 percent of women were in favor of a third party, while 29 percent said the parties do an adequate job.Overall, 65 percent of millennials think the country is on the wrong track.The survey was conducted October 26 to November 10, among a nationally representative sample of 1,876 adults aged 18-34."
"US District Judge James Donato ruled Wednesday that the Albany Unified School District did not violate students’ freedom of speech when they expelled one student for creating an Instagram account that hosted racist content and suspended nine other students who “liked” the posts, according to court documents obtained by RT America.The ruling comes from a lawsuit filed by the 10 students, who claimed that the school violated their free speech rights. Donato ruled that the posts were “within the scope of the First Amendment,” but also found that the posts qualify as “school speech” that he said is “potentially subject to greater regulation by school authorities.”In November 2016, a student referred to as “CE” created a private Instagram account with the handle @yungcavage and invited other students at the school to follow the account. CE posted 30 to 40 memes that featured other students and faculty at the school, which included “racist and derogatory” comments.The posts included images of fellow students with nooses drawn around their necks, and “multiple comparisons of African-American women and students to gorillas.” One post featured images of a noose, a burning torch, a black doll, and a white hood, with the caption “Ku klux starter pack.”After one of the students showed the images to one of the targets in March, another student asked CE if they could borrow his phone to make a call. When the student took CE’s phone to the bathroom, they took photos of the posts with their phone and sent them to other classmates.By lunchtime that day, a group of the targeted students brought the account to the attention of the principal. CE quickly disabled the account after discovering other students had seen the posts. CE was permanently expelled for his actions and the other students who followed the account were suspended for “various periods of time.” One student had access to the account but “never accessed the account to view any of the dialogue or images that were posted.” The student, referred to as Nick Noe in the ruling, claims he was not aware of the content posted by CE until he was questioned by school officials in March.In the lawsuit, the students argued they should not be punished because they were not on campus when they were posting, sharing and commenting on the content. However, the school district argued that the student’s actions “satisfied both the nexus and reasonable foreseeability approaches, and so were subject to discipline as school speech.”Donato agreed, saying that the school was allowed to discipline students for speech that “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.”“School officials do not have to wait for the disruption or invasion to take place; they may act prophylactically if it is reasonable under the circumstances,” Donato wrote in the ruling, adding that the targeted students “have the right to be free of online posts that denigrate their race, ethnicity or physical appearance, or threaten violence.”The students also argued that their actions were protected under a 1969 Supreme Court ruling that says a school must demonstrate that a student’s speech would lead to a “substantial disruption” of the school environment or an invasion of students’ rights. According to the ruling, after the students targeted by the posts found out, they gathered in a hallway at the school, where they were found “crying hysterically and talking loudly about the posts.”“I had never seen a group of students as upset as these girls were. The intensity of the crying and the yelling was very disturbing and disruptive,” one school administrator said, according to the ruling.The school called mental health counselors to deal with the students, and after seeing the posts, called the Albany police because “the posts could be construed as threats of violence.”“Taken as a whole, the record firmly establishes that CE caused a substantial disruption,” Donato said in the ruling.However, Donato said that the discipline taken against Noe was “troubling in many respects,” because he did not comment or like any of the posts. “Giving schools the power to control what students are permitted to look at online is a deeply problematic proposition,” Donato said in the ruling, adding that Noe “engaged in protected First Amendment activity.”Donato overturned the suspensions of four of the students who made no comments to only inoffensive ones, but upheld the suspension for the other students and CE’s expulsion. He also denied a request to have the suspensions removed the the student’s permanent records.“Some of the plaintiffs have tried to minimize their culpability by saying that their likes were made casually and thoughtlessly. But a plaintiff’s subjective state of mind is irrelevant,” Donato said in the ruling, adding that it only matters “whether the speech at issue interfered with the rights of other students to be secure and let alone.”Attorney Darryl Dale Yorkey, who represents six of the students, said the ruling puts the First Amendment “under fire.”“Where does the government’s ability to discipline you stop?” Yorkey told Courthouse News. “We live in a society where everyone has the entitlement not to be offended.”"
"On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) called to delay the next vote on their version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act until 11:00 am Friday, as Republicans make final changes to ensure they have the votes.McCain, who was considered to be a key holdout, released a statement, saying that he would support the bill. McCain called the bill “far from perfect,” but said that it would “enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle-class families.”After careful consideration, I have decided to support the Senate #TaxReform bill. Though not perfect, this bill will deliver much-needed reform to our tax code, grow the economy & provide long overdue tax relief for American families. https://t.co/BeWZAT0SjMpic.twitter.com/6qwYhmyE5pHowever, even with McCain’s vote, Republicans can't afford to lose more than two votes from their caucus, or the bill fails.During the floor debate, Senators Bob Corker (R-Tennessee), Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) and Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) sparked tension when they initially withheld support on a vote to move forward with the bill.Several lawmakers huddled around the senators until they eventually voted “nay” on a motion to send the bill back to the Finance Committee, which would have stalled the vote.Drama on the Senate floor. 3 Republicans -- Corker, Johnson and Flake -- are holding out on vote to send the tax bill back to committee. pic.twitter.com/OEvV6y03g3Corker, who announced he will not seek reelection next year, wanted to add a “trigger mechanism” to the bill that would automatically increase taxes if the bill failed to boost the economy and generate enough revenue to cover the estimated deficit expansion.The Senate parliamentarian barred Corker’s proposed provision on procedural grounds.“It doesn’t look like the trigger is going to work, according to the parliamentarian,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said, according to Politico. “So we have an alternative, frankly: a tax increase we don’t want to do to try to address Senator Corker’s concerns.”Trump’s plan to rewrite the American tax code for the first time in three decades is nearing a final Senate vote https://t.co/bLdBOOuN6jSenator Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has yet to commit to the bill, proposed an amendment to increase the corporate tax rate from 20 percent to 22 percent in order to allow homeowners to deduct up to $10,000 in local property taxes on their federal returns.“I have talked with many CEOs who have called to lobby me and they start as saying that they'd really love to have the rate go to 20, and then I say, what about 22 percent? Would that change your decision-making?” Collins said, according to Politico. “And they say we'd be happy with 22 percent.”Senators Johnson and Steve Daines (R-Montana) initially withheld support over concerns that the bill would benefit businesses paying the corporate tax rate over businesses that are taxed on an owner’s individual returns.Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) proposed an amendment that would require a two-thirds vote to make cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits.“It is my absolute belief that as soon as this tax proposal is completed and drives the deficit up by $1.4 trillion, I have zero doubt that my Republican colleagues are going to come back to the floor of the Senate and suddenly say, ‘Oh my goodness, the deficit has gone up, we have got to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,” Sanders said Thursday.Sanders demanded that Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pennsylvania) guarantee that he would not vote to cut the programs in the future.Toomey promised not to support “any cuts to people who are on the program and need those benefits.”“There it is!” Sanders interrupted. “He just told you he’s going to cut Social Security.”Sanders said Republicans are planning to raise the retirement age to 70 or privatize Medicare.Toomey responded that if Republicans wanted to make cuts to any of those programs, they could have added it to the current bill.“There is no secret plan,” Toomey said. “If we wanted to make these changes in Medicare and Medicaid this would be the vehicle because we have reconciliation protection to do it.”Tonight I asked my Republican colleague Sen. Toomey to guarantee to the American people there would not be cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid after this tax bill. He couldn't do that. pic.twitter.com/Svd2F8o2NyOn Thursday, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation released an analysis that the estimates the tax bill could generate enough growth to create nearly $408 billion in new revenue, but would add an estimated $1 trillion to deficits."
"Cluster bombs are anti-personnel and anti-vehicle weapons launched from aircraft or artillery that disperse as many as several hundred bomblets over a large area. The munitions sometimes fail to detonate on impact and continue to pose mortal danger to civilians for years after conflicts end.Pentagon putting off indefinitely a planned 2019 ban on using cluster bombs; they release explosive bomblets that can kill indiscriminately and pose hazards to civilians: https://t.co/HFQWF21w9nThe Department of Defense said it will not meet a January 1 2019 deadline, set in 2008 by the George W. Bush administration, for cluster bomb technology to meet a performance standard of failing to detonate 1 percent or less of the time.“We cannot risk mission failure or accept the potential of increased military and civilian casualties by forfeiting the best available capabilities,” the Pentagon said in a statement about delaying the ban, according to Reuters.Cluster munitions have been widely condemned by rights groups for their impact on civilians. The new policy embraced by the Trump administration says that “cluster munitions are legitimate weapons with clear military utility,” and that they may result in less unintended harm to civilians, according to Stars and Stripes.The new rules authorize the use of existing cluster bombs “until sufficient quantities” of a safer version are developed. It does not specify what sufficient quantities are, and defines “safer” as meeting the 1 percent standard from the previous policy, by developing a self-destruct mechanism in the bomb, or removing the bomb’s ability to explode by exhaustion of its power source.“The Department of Defense has determined that cluster munitions remain a vital military capability in the tougher warfighting environment ahead of us, while still a relatively safe one,” Pentagon spokesman Tom Crosson said in a statement. “This was a hard choice, not one the department made lightly.”Several Democrats in the Senate criticized the decision, with Dianne Feinstein (D-California) calling it “unbelievable” while Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) said it was another example of the Pentagon failing to keep promises.“A decade ago, the Pentagon announced that by 2018 it would no longer use cluster munitions with a failure rate exceeding one percent. On the eve of that deadline, the Pentagon has decided to go back on its commitment, just as it did after pledging to develop alternatives to anti-personnel landmines more than two decades ago,” Leahy said in a statement. “In these cases the Pentagon not only can’t be relied on to keep its commitment; it is perpetuating the use of an indiscriminate weapon that has been shown to have high failure rates, with devastating consequences for civilians.”.@SenatorLeahy: ""The Pentagon is perpetuating the use of an indiscriminate weapon that has been shown to have high failure rates, with devastating consequences for civilians.” https://t.co/PgQFbRsCqDMary Wareham, arms division director for Human Rights Watch, also spoke up against the new policy.“The US says it can’t produce ‘safe’ cluster munitions, so it has decided to keep using ‘unsafe’ ones,” she said. “We condemn this decision to reverse the long-held U.S. commitment not to use cluster munitions that fail more than 1 percent of the time, resulting in deadly unexploded sub-munitions.”A 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions bans all use, production, transfer and stockpiling of the weapon. Over 100 countries signed the pact as full parties and 17 as signatories, but the US declined to do so.The US has used cluster munitions in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Grenada, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia (including Kosovo), Montenegro, Afghanistan and Iraq. Amnesty International documented a 2010 US attack on Yemen which apparently used cluster bombs and killed 41 civilians including 21 children.In 2016, the Obama administration halted its transfer of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia, after rights groups condemned use of indiscriminate weapons in Yemen."
"“CNN, don't forget these other WikiLeaks’ ‘contacts’ and ‘intermediaries’: Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper & Brian Stelter who also all interviewed me in 2016,” Assange tweeted on Thursday, referring to three of the network’s hosts and journalists. “Stone continues to troll you silly, but being fake news, you love it.”CNN, don't forget these other WikiLeaks' ""contacts"" and ""intermediaries"": Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper & Brian Stelter who also all interviewed me in 2016. ""confirms report""? It's Stone's report. Stone continues to troll you silly, but being fake news, you love it. https://t.co/KtGxhm1S5YYou're obfuscating and taking cheap shots. This isn't about private communication between you and Stone. This is about him naming this radio host as an intermediary.Jake Tapper talking to Hillary Clinton about my interview with him means he's my ""intermediary"" with Clinton. I get it. You do you, CNN. https://t.co/KtGxhm1S5YEarlier on Thursday, CNN reported that Stone had said Credico was “an intermediary between him and Assange.” The article said Stone had declined to reveal Credico’s name to the House Intelligence Committee but later did so privately.The House Intelligence Committee is investigating allegations that Russians meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied interference or collusion with the Trump campaign. The committee is interested in Stone and Credico because of a statement in which Stone appeared to predict that WikiLeaks would soon release damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Stone has denied any prior knowledge of WikiLeaks’ publications.Where the word “intermediary” came from it is not clear. In a Facebook post, Stone said Wednesday that Credico merely confirmed what Assange had said publicly in an interview with British ITV network.“Randy Credico is a good man,” Stone wrote. “The Committee is wasting their time. He merely confirmed what Assange had said publicly. He was correct. Wikileaks did have the goods on Hillary and they did release them.”In an interview with RT, Credico called the House Intelligence committee investigation modern-day McCarthysm and a witch hunt.“They are going after me, why? Because of my connection with Julian Assange. I have been interviewing him for the last year and a half. I’ve had him on my show; I have been to the embassy,” Credico told RT. “This is just another way to keep this phony Russiagate inquiry alive.”Credico said the US government is going after Wikileaks because of its exposure of what the US had been doing in Syria, in Libya, in Palestine.“All of that they want to keep suppressed from the public,” said Credico. “I want to know about it! And Assange is perhaps the most gifted person to get that stuff out.”One of CNN’s reporters, David Wright, got into a Twitter fight with Assange over the story.“Use whatever phrase you want, but arguing semantics isn’t helping your case. And no one is asserting anything about Stone’s credibility here, merely reporting what he’s told investigators. Wonder why you're so upset, though,” Wright tweeted.“I see. For CNN ‘once interviewed him’ is the same as ‘intermediary’ in a plot to overthrow America. We're done here. Please have the FCC put that warning label on your homeopathic ‘news’ placebo,” Assange replied."

"James O’Keefe, founder of Project Veritas and self-described “guerrilla journalist,” has made a number of enemies among the media by using his undercover techniques not against the usual suspects –government and corporate insiders, for example – but against the media establishment itself. And lately, O’Keefe, together with his young team of collaborators, has taken on the myth of “Russiagate.”The latest to fall prey to Project Veritas just happened to be one of the largest purveyors of the “Russia meddling” story, the Washington Post (WaPo), which claims that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to steal an otherwise certain victory from Hillary Clinton in the 2016 elections.In a conversation with an undercover Project Veritas “reporter,” WaPo's national security reporter, Adam Entous, who is assigned to the Russia beat, let the proverbial cat out of the bag regarding the “Russiagate” story.Here is a portion of the conversation as it played out inside of a bustling drinking spot.Adam Entous:Our reporting has not taken us to a place where I would be able to say with any confidence that the result of it is going to be the president being guilty of being in cahoots with the Russians. There's no evidence of that that I've seen so far.Project Veritas:There has to be something, right?Entous:Maybe, maybe not. It could just be lower-level people being manipulated or manipulating, but it's very hard to, it's really...It's a f*cking black box.We've seen a lot of flirtation, if you will, between them but nothing that, in my opinion, would rank as actual collusion. Now that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, it just means we haven't found it yet. Or maybe it doesn't exist.I mean it's a f*cking crap shoot. I literally have no prediction whatsoever as to what would happen, and I do all the stuff for the Post on this so...PV:How do we get the president?Entous:I have no idea. And frankly, there may not be anything that gets the president.Entous has authored literally dozens of Russian-related stories for WaPo, with headlines like, “Add Google to the list of tech companies used by Russians to spread disinformation,” and “Google uncovers Russian-bought ads on YouTube, Gmail and other platforms” and “Russian Facebook ads showed a black woman firing a rifle, amid efforts to stoke racial strife.”Project Veritas, a conservative group specializing in what it says are undercover sting videos, has released a number of videos on US media outlets in a series dubbed “American Pravda.” The group has so far targeted CNN and the New York Times. The investigative work of Mr. O'Keefe has not been without heated criticism from individuals who reject his undercover methods.Perhaps his most famous piece of “reporting” involved the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), which conducted voter registration drives across the United States among low and working-class voters. The Republican Party regularly charged the group with voter fraud, but had no way to prove it.In 2009, O’Keefe entered several ACORN offices pretending to be a pimp, and accompanied by a “prostitute.” The video he released alleged to show staff encouraging criminal behavior. Although ACORN employees had been cleared of any wrongdoing as suggested by Project Veritas, the damage had been done. On November 2, 2010, its US offices filed for bankruptcy, effectively ending the work of the non-government organization.In 2010, O’Keefe was sentenced to three years’ probation, 100 hours of community service and a $1,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges stemming from entering then-Sen. Mary Landrieu’s (D-La.) office on false pretenses."

John Conyers is hospitalized in Detroit.  https://t.co/SnADGfQ9Vq""The congressman's health is not what it should be and a lot of that is directly attributable to this media assault,” Biddle said. ""The reality is these serial accusers have done this before, we're used to it.""Last week, BuzzFeed published a report that claiming that Conyers settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 with a former employee, who said she was fired for refusing his sexual advances and “blackballed” into accepting a settlement of $27,000.Conyers initially denied the allegations. He later admitted he had reached a financial settlement with a former staffer who had accused him of sexual misconduct. He denied having done anything improper, however.Marion Brown, a former deputy chief of staff to Conyers, told NBC’s ‘Today’ show on Thursday that she was the former employee named in the report.""It was sexual harassment, violating my body, propositioning me, inviting me to hotels with the guise of discussing business and propositioning for sex,'' Brown said. ""He just violated my body, he's touched me in different ways. It was very uncomfortable and very unprofessional.""The House Ethics Committee is investigating the allegations. Conyers, the longest serving representative in the House, announced last Sunday that he would step aside as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.Pelosi: “The allegations against Congressman Conyers, as we have learned more since Sunday, are serious, disappointing and very credible. It’s very sad. The brave women who came forward are owed justice.” https://t.co/iGIr3PpZayConyers has faced numerous calls to resign from fellow Democrats and public figures. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) called on Conyers to resign Thursday morning. Pelosi called the allegations are “serious, disappointing and very credible.”""We are at a watershed moment for our country in the fight against sexual harassment and discrimination,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to the ethics panel on Tuesday. “The Committee on Ethics has a great responsibility to proceed expeditiously as well as fairly into any investigation of credible harassment and discrimination allegations.""It is not easy for me to reach this conclusion because, as a civil rights activist, I have looked up to Representative Conyers for decades.

"The US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has called for the complete isolation of North Korea, including cutting all trade links. She was speaking at an emergency Security Council session, following Pyongyang’s latest ballistic missile test. Haley said North Korea is pushing the world closer to war.RT asked Gregory Elich, Advisory Board member at the Korea Policy Institute whether the US diplomat has a point.pic.twitter.com/gqYZlB8cDIGregory Elich: It is not North Korea that is pushing the world closer to war, I think the Trump administration is doing so. Going back, Joseph Yun, who is US Special Representative for North Korea Policy, told a meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations that if North Korea refrained from nuclear and missile testing for 60 days, the US would engage in direct dialogue with North Korea.North Korea did better than that – they went two and a half months without doing any tests whatsoever. And what kind of reward did they get? The Trump administration sent B-1 bombers over South Korea practicing the bombing of North Korea. The Trump administration sent three aircraft carriers off the shore of the Korean Peninsula to practice bombing over North Korea. Then Trump designated North Korea as a state-sponsor of terrorism. The Trump administration is doing absolutely everything possible to kill off any possibilities of diplomacy. I think the North Koreans got fed up with this one-sided approach. So they went back to fast-track development of their missile program, which they see as a defensive measure against the threats that they are getting from the Trump administration.North Korea releases photos of ICBM from latest test ‘capable of striking US’RT:Nikki Haley called for all trade with North Korea to be shut down. Most of its trade is with China. Do you think it is a hint for Beijing to take some specific action against the North Koreans?GE: I think it is more than a hint. The discussions between US officials and Chinese officials – every time there is heavy duty pressure on the Chinese officials to bend to the US demands to basically cut off all trade with North Korea. I don’t think that the Chinese want to do that because it would have disastrous humanitarian results, there’ll be a humanitarian crisis. Already the sanctions are so severe that they threaten a severe economic impact on the people of North Korea.Daniel McAdams, executive director at Ron Paul Institute, says that Haley is behaving more like a “bull in a china shop” than a diplomat.RT:What do you make of Nikki Haley's remarks on North Korea, and how could it affect this standoff?Daniel McAdams: As usual, Haley is not a diplomat, she is a bull in a china shop, so to speak. She is baring all the neocon talking points at the UN. The idea of kicking North Korea out of the UN. The UN is a forum for diplomacy; it was designed to help avoid war. The idea of kicking them out of that forum just shows what her real agenda is. It is the same agenda that we heard from Lindsey Graham is a matter of fact word for word: if war happens, it’ll be North Korea’s fault. If war happens, it would be that the US has decided to attack North Korea. Frankly, I don’t think that is going to happen, but they are trying to ramp it up to the very closest point to war. That is the problem because it could lead to many mistakes.RT:What do you think Kim Jong-un will be thinking, listening to this latest threat from the US?DM: Of course the problem is always misinterpretation. Both leaders are speaking in code – they are calling each other names, they are not at the table talking. The real problem is misunderstanding. I think the North Korea’s leader Kim is playing a very rational game. He is trying to establish the fact that he has a sufficient deterrent to keep South Korea, the US, and Japan from attacking him. That is a very rational thing. That is what countries do. It doesn’t mean you endorse these policies. But the idea that he is behaving like a madman is absolutely not true."
"“The Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man,” Trump tweeted, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Beijing sent a special envoy, Director of the Communist Party’s International Liaison Department Song Tao, to Pyongyang for the first time since late 2016 in mid-November.The Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.US State Secretary Rex Tillerson, however, welcomed the Chinese efforts aimed at resolving the crisis on the Korean Peninsula. However, he also said that Beijing should do even more by particularly imposing stricter restrictions on its oil exports to North Korea.“The Chinese are doing a lot,” Tillerson said on Thursday. He added, though, that the US “does think they could do more with the oil.”“We're really asking them to please restrain more of the oil, not cut it off completely,” he said in remarks at the State Department, as reported by Reuters.Earlier, Trump hailed the Chinese decision as a “big move,” adding that he would see “what happens.” He also urged President Xi Jinping to act fast to rein in North Korea, warning that “time is quickly running out.”The US president has repeatedly said that China should play a more active role in containing Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions. Meanwhile, Washington and Beijing have held substantially different views on how to handle the crisis on the Korean Peninsula.While Washington tends to resort to threats, pressure and sanctions; Beijing, together with Moscow, has called for restraint and dialog to resolve the issue. Most recently, China called on all “relevant parties” to resume talks and make efforts to settle the crisis “through dialogue and consultation.” The statement was made after the US added Pyongyang to its list of terrorist sponsors.However, the recent developments have once again heightened tensions around the peninsula. Trump’s latest comments came after Pyongyang tested yet another ballistic missile, which the Pentagon claimed was intercontinental. North Korea also stated that it was a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US mainland.The missile launch provoked an angry reaction in the US. On Thursday, the US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warned that the test had brought Pyongyang and Washington “closer to war” and called for additional sanctions against North Korea. Trump also announced that he would put forth “additional major sanctions” against the North.Earlier, in November, North Korean Ambassador to the UN Han Tae Song ruled out negotiations on its nuclear program. He explained Pyongyang’s decision by citing the “hostile” policy of the US, as well as joint US-South Korean military drills in the region.China and Russia came up with the so-called “double-freeze” plan to resolve the Korean crisis soon after the tensions escalated in early September. The two countries called it the only viable alternative to a “catastrophe, where there will be no winners or losers.”The plan envisages the US and its allies halting all major military exercises in the region in exchange for Pyongyang suspending its nuclear and ballistic missile program. The initiative was, however, turned down by Washington, with Haley denouncing it as “insulting.”Meanwhile, Russia believes that the latest North Korean missile launch was in fact triggered by hostile rhetoric from the US and constant pressure that Washington exerts on Pyongyang. Russian Senator Konstantin Kosachev, the head of Russia's Foreign Affairs Committee, pointed out that Pyongyang “demonstrated restraint” and made no provocative moves for over two months prior to the launch, apparently expecting the same restraint from the US.However, over the same period, the US conducted several military drills in the region together with its allies, with some of the exercises involving three US aircraft carriers. The North’s decision to remind Washington of its own military capabilities apparently shows that Pyongyang’s patience has run out, Kosachev said."
"During an emergency session of the UN Security Council on Wednesday, Haley asked the members of the panel to increase the sanctions imposed on North Korea and to implement penalties established by the council earlier in the year, The Hill reported.Haley also warned the panel that North Korea's latest missile test has brought Pyongyang and Washington “closer to war.”“If war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed,” Haley said.“The dictator of North Korea made a choice yesterday that brings the world closer to war, not farther from it,” Ambassador Haley added.Also on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said that he would put forth “additional major sanctions” against North Korea in reaction to the recent ICBM test. Trump added that “the situation will be handled.”North Korea's latest ICBM test on Tuesday was its first in more than two months, and the rocket that was launched flew further than any previous launches. The distance of the launch allegedly put the US mainland into the range of the missile, according to North Korean state media.As a result of the continuous pressure the US has put on Pyongyang, on November 20, Trump officially declared North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism.While speaking of the designation, Trump said: “In addition to threatening the world with nuclear devastation, North Korea has supported international acts of terrorism including assassinations on foreign soil.”On November 15, as tensions between the two countries continued to heat up, the US military stated their B-1 bombers are capable of dropping nuclear weapons, and the US possesses “secret silos” of nuclear hardware.US Strategic Command, which is responsible for the Department of Defense's global operations, shared a KPNX article on Twitter to back up their claims, but subsequently faced backlash from users on the social media platform calling it “false and misleading.”And earlier in November, Pyongyang's ambassador to the UN, Han Tae Song, ruled out negotiations over its nuclear program in November, citing US-South Korea military exercises in the waters off of the Korean peninsula, which the north sees as a threat to their country.""As long as there is a continuous hostile policy against my country by the US and as long as there are continued war games on our doorstep, then there will not be negotiations,"" he said.READ MORE: Fears of nuclear Trumpocalypse prompt Hawaii to reinstate Cold War-era attack sirensIn October, North Korea mimicked the the Trump administration’s tough talk and threatened an ""unimaginable"" strike on the US, as tensions further ramped up over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, North Korean state media reported.Haley’s comments are a continuation of the Trump administration’s responses to North Korean military displays. The president stated in August that he would unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea if it continued threatening the US and its allies."
".@Theresa_May, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!UK Prime Minister May condemned Trump through her spokesperson James Slack on Wednesday afternoon, after Trump three times retweeted videos depicting Muslims in various parts of the world committing violent and destructive acts. The tweets were originally posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, an anti-Islam, neo-Nazi group.“It’s wrong for the president to have done this,” James Slack said of Trump’s Wednesday morning retweets.Trump, a self-proclaimed counter-puncher, slapped back at May in a tweet reprimanding her for criticizing him.“Don’t focus on me,” Trump tweeted, initially tagging the wrong account for the UK prime minister.“Focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom,” he added.Trump then went on to tweet that the US is “doing just fine,” but never clarified his reason for retweeting the Britain First leader.Slack, May’s spokesman, also said Wednesday that Britain First “seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives that stoke tensions” and “is the antithesis of the values that this country represents: decency, tolerance and respect.”Fransen was convicted last year of religiously aggravated harassment for accosting a hijab-clad Muslim mother in front of her children during a “Christian patrol” organized by Britain First. Earlier this month, she was arrested and charged with “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour” for a speech she gave in August at a rally near Belfast City Hall in Northern Ireland. She is set to appear in court on December 14.May was the first foreign elected official to visit the White House after Trump became president. The US and UK relationship has long been deemed “special” by presidents of both mainstream US parties, including Trump himself."
"Ragtime is a NSA surveillance program that collects the contents of private communications of foreign nationals, including emails and text messages. A newly revealed component of the program, called US-P, seems to be aimed at American citizens.The term ‘USP’ (US Persons) is used in intelligence circles to refer to American citizens. A document dated November 2011, seen by both ZDNet and UpGuard, revealed the existence of US-P and six other previously unknown Ragtime components. In addition to Ragtime US-P, the newly revealed variants are called Ragtime-BQ, F, N, PQ, S, and T, according to ZDNet.#NSA's #Ragtime program targets Americans, leaked files show https://t.co/iwxXskKEli via @zackwhittakerThe document was found among the contents of a highly sensitive hard drive left unprotected and publicly available on an Amazon server. Containing more than 100 gigabytes, the drive belonged to the US Army's Intelligence and Security Command, a subdivision of the Army and NSA.UpGuard discovered the trove in September and informed the Pentagon. The California-based cybersecurity startup revealed the existence of the vulnerability to the public earlier this month.Ragtime collects data from as many as 50 service providers. The program is divided into components, four of which were previously known to exist. Ragtime-A collects foreign-to-foreign counterterrorism data, Ragtime-B focuses on data traveling through the US from foreign governments, and Ragtime-C collects information on the nuclear counterproliferation effort. Ragtime-P is said to stand for the Patriot Act, a broad surveillance program that allows authorities to collect bulk metadata on calls and emails sent through telecom provider networks.The program’s existence was revealed in the 2013 book ‘Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry,’ authored by Marc Ambinder and D.B. Grady. Developed in the George W. Bush era following the September 11th attacks, Ragtime is part of a broader collections of systems under the STELLARWIND program of warrantless surveillance programs. The highly secretive program is accessible by only a few NSA staffers.Congress restricted the Ragtime program following a series of leaks in 2008. The NSA was no longer allowed to collect information under the Ragtime-P variant, however the NSA retained the data and authorized analysts were permitted to use the data previously collected. Of the 30,000 NSA employees, only a few dozen have access to Ragtime data, according to Slate. However, more than 1,000 people “outside the NSA are privy to the full details of the program” according to the revelations in ‘Deep State.’Though citizens are largely protected from government surveillance by the fourth amendment, there are exceptions, The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court can authorize government officials based on probable cause to spy on American citizens suspected of working for a foreign power.Lawmakers are due to pass a bill to ensure the continuity of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If the bill does not pass before the end of the year, the NSA could lose the authorities the program provides. The PRISM program, which was revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013, derives authorization from the same act."

"As the US political-media complex continues to saturate the American psyche with the bad seed of Russophobia, harassing anyone who dares deviate from the narrative, Cohen, of New York and Princeton Universities, is one of the few scholars bucking the trend.In his latest contribution in a lengthy series of articles published in the Nation, Cohen argues that Russia fails to make it among the top-five threats facing the United States today.Cohen begins by arguing that ever since the late 1940s, the single “existential duty” of every US president has been to avoid “the possibility of war with Russia.” The reason is obvious: the risk of touching off a “conflagration that could result in the end of modern civilization.”According to Cohen, Donald Trump is the first US leader who has lost those critical presidential powers due to the dissemination of “still unverified but ever-more-persistent allegations” that Trump somehow colluded with the Kremlin to steal the 2016 presidential elections from Hillary Clinton.It is that accusation, which has dogged the American public – not to mention the White house – for over a year, that Cohen ranks as the “number-one threat” confronting America today.The professor roundly criticized the ongoing spate of warmongering found not only in the mainstream media, but in the halls of power as well.Referencing a comment by Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking member, who described the allegations of ‘Russian election meddling’ as a “political Pearl Harbor,” Cohen asked, “What could be more reckless than to insist that we are already at war with the other nuclear superpower?”The diplomatic breakdown between the two countries hit rock bottom in August when the US forced Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and cut back its diplomatic staff in Washington and New York. The tit-for-tat move came in response to Moscow announcing the US would have to scale back its embassy and consulate personnel in Russia by 755, months after the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats and closed Russian property over the claim that Moscow had meddled in the 2016 US elections.On the point of Vladimir Putin and the Western establishment’s ongoing efforts to place him in practically the same category as of Hitler, Cohen calls wave of attacks “unprecedented.”“No Soviet or post-Soviet leader was ever so wildly, baselessly vilified as Putin has increasingly been for more than a decade—and even more since a few selected members of a few US intelligence agencies claimed in January 2017, without making known any evidence whatsoever, that he personally ordered the ‘attack on America’,” Cohen wrote.Always in the background of Cohen’s commentary is the reminder that we are living in the nuclear age, a fact that makes bilateral cooperation between Moscow and Washington an absolute imperative. Yet thanks to the allegations of ‘Russiagate’, which some Republicans and Trump himself say were concocted to explain Hillary Clinton’s loss, as well as conceal numerous skeletons in the Democratic closet, Putin has been characterized as a “master villain in the Kremlin.”“Despite the ongoing bashing of the Russian leader, the result has been that Vladimir Putin, the ‘national-security partner most needed by Washington’, has been effectively delegitimized.”The loss of Russia as a reliable US partner represents a massive setback in the fight against real global baddies, foremost among them Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS), which Cohen said would be the “number one [threat] if the US political-media establishment had not conjured up the preceding ones.”But the nuclear issue is also of key importance here, according to the scholar.“The high-alert/hair-trigger status of American and Russian nuclear weapons is an accident waiting to happen,” which requires Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to negotiate “an end to that perilous status,” he wrote.Cohen wraps up his article with a short explanation as to why Russia does not feature on his list of US threats.“Russia… represents no threat to the United States at all (apart from a nuclear accident or miscalculation), except those Washington and NATO have themselves created. Meanwhile, the “expanding alliance between Russia and China,” symptomatic of “unwise” US policy, is a “separate subject.”"
"Today Show co-host Savannah Guthrie announced Wednesday morning that Lauer had been terminated, citing a letter from NBC News chairman Andy Lack, which informed staff of a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer.”Trump wasted no time, taking to social media to ask when “top executives at NBC and Comcast” will be fired “for putting out so much fake news.” He then took aim at Lack, alluding to his “past.”Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.” But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack’s past!Trump declined to make any specific allegations against Lack, who has worked at NBC off and on since 1993. He became chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment in 2003, and briefly served as the head of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), the US government's broadcasting agency. After just four months on the job in 2015, Lack resigned to re-join NBC.In a second tweet, Trump took aim at MSNBC President Phil Griffin, as well as his former friend Joe Scarborough, referencing an “unsolved mystery” in which Scarborough's intern died in 2001. A medical examiner determined the cause of death to be natural causes.So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!Trump has long been on a crusade against so-called “fake news,” taking aim at CNN just hours before addressing Lauer’s sacking from NBC. “We should boycott fake news CNN. Dealing with them is a total waste of time!” he tweeted after learning that the news outlet would be boycotting the White House Christmas party.Great, and we should boycott Fake News CNN. Dealing with them is a total waste of time! https://t.co/8zJ3j7g5elOn Monday, Trump said a “contest” should be held as to which of the major networks and CNN – but not including Fox News – is the “most dishonest, corrupt, and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president (me).”We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!“They are all bad,” he wrote, adding that the winner would receive a “fake news trophy.”"
"On Tuesday, US Army General John Nicholson, commander of the US and NATO mission in Afghanistan, told reporters that the “Taliban cannot win” under a new US strategy in the area. However, it is not the first time that US officials have made similar proclamations.During a video briefing at the Pentagon, Nicholson said that 2018 would be a different year for US-led coalition forces in the country.One hundred days after President Donald Trump announced his South Asia strategy, Nicholson said that the new plan has been a “game changer,” which has helped put the Afghan government forces “on a path to a win.”“We can see the impacts already, especially in terms of our adversary's reactions,” Nicholson said.Nicholson said that there have been two changes to the enemy’s strategies that indicate “a lowering of ambition by the enemy.” First, Nicholson said that the Taliban has shifted from taking capitals to a district-focused strategy. Then, he said they shifted to guerrilla-style warfare, not to gain and control territory, but to be “relevant.”Trump’s strategy involves sending 3,000 new US troops to the region and giving coalition forces increased authority to drop more than three times the number of bombs.Nicholson said that one of the most important changes came after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fired five of his six corps commanders and named a new chief of general staff and defense minister.“The Afghan commanders that make up that core have never lost a battle against the Taliban and they never will. They are the most feared and respected force in Afghanistan today and they’re the best special operations force in the region,” Nicholson said.Looking ahead to 2018, Nicholson said that US and Afghan forces have “turned the corner” and “the momentum is now with the Afghan security forces.”The statement come a week after Nicholson told NBC News that the war in Afghanistan remained in a “stalemate,” but said that he had confidence in President Donald Trump’s new strategy in the region.“We are only 90 days into this new policy, but with the US forces that will be arriving, with the new authority that we have been given, put the pressure on external enablers, with the fact that we are condition based and not time based, we've set all the conditions to win,” Nicholson told NBC News.However, US officials have used similar phrases to describe the situation in Afghanistan several times in the 16 years since the war began.Obama, 2011: We have ‘turned the corner’ in fight against TalibanPanetta, 2012: we have ‘turned the corner’ in fight against TalibanGen. Nicholson, 2017: we have ‘turned the corner’ in fight against Taliban https://t.co/tUg0ojTz3GIn January 2013, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that Afghan forces had turned the corner in their fight against the Taliban. He predicted that Islamic extremists would not be able to gain a foothold in the country to enforce their religious agenda.“I think there is now a critical mass in Afghanistan of the educated, of the Afghan people who want a future of progress and stability. And I think, also, that the Taliban have recognized that the corner has been turned,” Karzai said, according to CNN.In September 2012, former US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that coalition forces had turned the corner after former President Barack Obama ordered a “surge” of 33,000 US troops to leave the country in the hands of Afghan security forces.“The surge did accomplish it objectives of reversing the Taliban momentum on the battlefield and dramatically increasing the size and capability of the Afghan national security forces,” Panetta said, according to the New York Post.READ MORE: ‘Moral bankruptcy’: US govt brushes child abuse under the carpet in Afghanistan – ex-diplomatIn June 2011, Obama told soldiers at Fort Drum in upstate New York that his strategy led to a turning point that would allow the surge in US troops to return home after training Afghan soldiers.“Last night, I gave a speech in which I said that we have turned a corner where we can begin to bring back some of our troops,” Obama said, according to White House archives. “But because of your outstanding work, what we’ve been able to do is train an additional 100,000 Afghan soldiers so that they can start carrying on the fight.”US soldier killed during operation in eastern Afghanistan https://t.co/6fCscrmt60pic.twitter.com/p6kPw6QBYNIn February 2010, Army General Stanley McChrystal, the former top US commander in Afghanistan, said he believed Helmand Province had “turned the corner.”“I am not prepared to make pronouncement on the country but they have clearly turned the corner here,” McChrystal told the Telegraph. “If we make it durable then I think it will become contagious.”Since then, Helmand has become one of the deadliest provinces in the country, with one Afghan General Wali Mohammad Ahmadzai telling NPR earlier this month that the area is “the mother of problems for the country.”READ MORE: US prepared to stay in Afghanistan indefinitely – Pentagon chiefsHowever, as recent as June 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee that coalition forces “are not winning in Afghanistan right now.”"
"The bill, unveiled by Senator Sanders on Tuesday called The Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands Equitable Rebuild Act of 2017, would give both US territories more federal funding for health care, transportation and education. The legislation also allots the US territories $51 million for economic development.It would be absurd to rebuild Puerto Rico’s antiquated, fossil fuel-dependent grid back the way it was. We must take advantage of the abundant sustainable energy they have.The legislation would grant a total of $62 billion to the governments of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands in order to address the territories’ economic challenges. It will also allot both governments $27 billion for infrastructure projects. Further, the plan awards $13 billion in additional funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to rebuild both territories’ electric grids using “more modern, resilient technologies,” according to a summary of the bill.The plan has the full support of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who previously blasted the administration of President Donald Trump for delivering what she believes to be a poor response in Puerto Rico, The Hill reported.In late September after Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, Cruz decried relief efforts being put forth by the Trump administration.“We are dying here,” Cruz said, according to the Guardian. Cruz added that if the administration didn’t  figure out the logistics of getting aid to Puerto Rico, “what we we are going to see is something close to a genocide.”In total, Maria caused nearly $100 billion in damage to the territory, which was already struggling financially before being decimated by the mega storm.After learning of the proposed plan, a former member of the Senate of Puerto Rico, Ramon Luis Nieves, touted Sanders’ bill as “the closest we have to a Marshall Plan for Puerto Rico,” according to the Washington Post.Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) commented on the importance of Sanders’ relief package, as she and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) both plan on co-sponsoring the bill.“I was glad to work closely with Senator Sanders on this far-reaching bill so that we can aid our fellow U.S. citizens and help them along a path to full recovery,"" Warren told the Post.READ MORE: Puerto Rico power chief resigns amid struggles after Hurricane MariaThe legislation, however, faces an uphill battle against the Republican-controlled Congress.In October, 17 Republican senators already voted against a $36.5 billion bipartisan disaster recovery bill that included $4.9 billion in loans for Puerto Rico and other territories destroyed by hurricanes, the Huffington Post reported.Republican lawmakers stated at the time that the legislation was fiscally irresponsible, but the legislation went on to pass in both the House and the Senate."
"Just won the lawsuit on leadership of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. A big win for the Consumer!The decision had been challenged by Leandra English, the agency's former acting deputy director, who claimed the leadership post on Monday, at the same time Mulvaney was installed. Her request for a restraining order was denied.The CFPB's former acting director Richard Cordray, an Obama-era holdover, had claimed that English was the rightful successor to the position. Mulvaney implored CFPB employees to disregard English's introductory email, in which she claimed to be the head of the consumer protection agency.Despite being made into a federal court case, the issue may soon be moot. President Donald Trump is expected to pick a permanent replacement in the coming weeks.The CFPB, created in the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, has been criticized as being unconstitutional and lacking proper oversight.When he was a member of Congress, current acting director Mulvaney called the agency a “joke” and sought to abolish it.On Monday, Mulvaney said at a press conference that “elections have consequences at every agency, and that includes the CFPB,” the Los Angeles Times reported.Mulvaney issued a 30-day hiring freeze as soon as he took the helm and told reporters: “Anything in the pipeline stops for at least 30 days.”"

"Speaking at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC on Tuesday, Tillerson said that Russia is using its nuclear arsenal to “impose its will on others by force.” As examples of this behavior, he cited the “invasions” of Georgia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014.“With the end of the Cold War, the imminent threat that everyone faced for that 70 year period was now diminishing. What we now realize is it didn’t,” he said. “It’s still defining itself; It’s still searching for its role in the name of Russia.”Secretary Tillerson at @TheWilsonCenter: We, together with our friends in Europe, recognize the active threat of recently resurgent #Russia. pic.twitter.com/S80Goa3oPaTillerson also criticized Russia for assisting the Syrian government – which, he said, showed “disregard for their own citizens” – in its battle against Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist groups.Russia intervened in Syria in 2015 after a US-backed proxy war brought the Syrian government to the brink of collapse. Russian and Syrian forces, along with the Lebanese Hezbollah group, reversed the trend and have nearly defeated the terrorist insurgents, including Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL).Despite alleging a Russian agenda of global dominance, Tillerson said that the US and Russia are working together to defeat Islamic State.“With respect to Russia, there are areas of mutual cooperation. We’re working hard in Syria to defeat ISIS and we’re on the cusp of having ISIS once and for all defeated in Syria,” he said.While Russia has assisted the Syrian military campaign, the US has backed a Kurdish-led separatist militia under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).Tillerson said that Russia is eager to cooperate with the US on counterterrorism efforts, but the Trump administration has declined to pursue those options.“There are many areas of cooperation with Russia, and they have many others they’d like to work with us on. We just don’t think it’s time to do that,” he said.The US may be interested in cooperating with Russia in Afghanistan, where Washington’s longest-ever war has failed to achieve its stated goals, Tillerson said.“There may be opportunities for cooperation in Afghanistan. We’ve not yet come to what that might be but we’re talking about it,” he said. The secretary also called on US allies in NATO to “maintain their commitment to Afghanistan.” After criticizing the war as a candidate, in October President Donald Trump recommitted the US to maintaining a military presence in Afghanistan for an indefinite period of time.In addition to calling on NATO members to maintaining a military presence in Afghanistan, Tillerson called on NATO allies to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on their military. He praised Albania, Croatia, France, Hungary and Romania for their newly stated commitment to reach the benchmark.The emergence of Islamic State-affiliated groups in west Africa demonstrates that the global war on terror “will continue to have new and unexpected origins,” Tillerson said. “We must take action so that areas like the Sahel or the Maghreb do not become the next breeding ground for ISIS, Al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups.”The US has committed “up to $60 million” in an effort to assist the G5 joint Sahel force to combat terrorism in Africa, Tillerson revealed. Islamist insurgencies sprouted in the region only after NATO-backed rebels deposed the Libyan government in 2011."
"When asked whether he would oppose the controversial “Audit the Fed” legislation, known officially as the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, Powell said that he would do so.“I do, and I’ll tell you why,” Powell told the Committee. “Congress has chosen to shield monetary policy from a policy audit from the GAO,” he added, meaning the Government Accountability Office.“That has been a wise choice made to show respect for the independence of monetary policy,” he added. “A GAO audit would be a way for Congress to insert itself into the making of monetary policy on a meeting-by-meeting basis.”All the top officials of the Fed have been opposing the bill since its first introduction back in 2009 by now-retired Representative Ron Paul (R-Texas). Other supporters of the bill have tried to introduce the legislation three times since then. While it passed in the House of Representatives every time, it would die in the Senate.During his election campaign, Trump was a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve and its lack of accountability. He criticized the incumbent Fed chair Janet Yellen for being “very political,” and accused her of artificially propping up the economy with low interest rates. Upon becoming president, however, Trump praised Yellen for being a “low-interest-rate-person.”The supporters of the idea to strip the Fed of its unique exemption and make it accountable to the GAO like other federal government bodies have seen Trump’s victory as a chance to finally squeeze the bill through the Congress.“The US House has responded to the American people by passing Audit the Fed multiple times, and President-elect Trump has stated his support for an audit. Let’s send him the bill this Congress,” Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) said back in January.Such hopes, however, were shaken on November 2, when Trump presented his nominee to become chairman of the Federal Reserve. Powell, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors since 2012, is a well-known critic of the ""Audit the Fed"" legislation and has repeatedly spoken against it."
"The state’s emergency management officials announced that the vintage air-raid sirens will be tested for the first time in nearly 30 years on Friday. The drill will last for 60 seconds and the system’s signature wail will be heard in more than 400 locations across the central Pacific islands.The public is asked to “get inside, stay inside and stay tuned” if they should hear the sirens.The potential threat of North Korean missile launches has prompted monthly tests of the warning system, Hawaiian authorities said.“Emergency preparedness is knowing what to expect and what to do for all hazards,” Hawaii Emergency Management Agency chief Vern Miyagi said in a video message posted online, according to Reuters.Hawaii is believed to be within range of North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missiles, and would be a likely target if war between Washington and Pyongyang broke out. Washington has adopted a hardline stance on North Korea, which has been exacerbated by an uptick in US military activity around the Korean Peninsula.US President Donald Trump has often used incendiary language when discussing North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un. In one notable case, he chided US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” his derogatory nickname for Kim.Both Moscow and Beijing have warned Washington against unilateral action to halt Pyongyang’s nuclear program, advocating instead for a diplomatic approach that won’t jeopardize regional security.Speaking at a press briefing at the UN General Assembly in September, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the verbal sparring between Trump and Jong-un as “a kindergarten fight between children.”"
"According to the quarterly report produced by the DMDC, which is itself a part of the US Department of Defense, on September 30 there were a total of 25,910 US troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, compared to the 14,765 declared by the Pentagon.In Iraq, there were 8,992 troops, not 5,262, in Afghanistan 15,298 troops, not 14,000, and in Syria the deployment appears to be three times bigger – 1,720 against the latest official level of 503.The data forced the Pentagon to acknowledge on Monday something that is widely known by military and Washington media, but is barely understood by the American public – that the US overseas mission figures regularly quoted by US officials are “not meant to represent an accurate accounting of troops deployed to any particular region.”Instead, the usual neat numbers signify so-called Force Management Levels (FMLs) – an Obama-era deployment cap that was used by the White House during the previous administration to restrict US involvement in foreign wars. Even before Donald Trump was elected, the actual numbers were usually different – and almost invariably higher – than those reported, as the US used counted some troops as being on “temporary assignments” while others were on “overlapping rotations.”“There are several other things that go into those numbers,” Colonel Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, attempted to explain, when challenged about the discrepancies. “It is a snapshot in time and have to also consider that number is quarterly. Our official deployment count has not changed.”But the Pentagon also admitted that the numbers – even the ones in the DMDC report – are fudged for military and diplomatic purposes.“We are going to be as transparent as we can possibly be without telegraphing or silhouetting ourselves to the enemy and showcasing our capabilities to the bad guys,” said Manning. “Some of that is based on operational security, some is based on agreements with partners and allies.”A good example of this seemingly willful obscurity is the US mission in Niger, where four American troops were killed in an ambush on October 4. A year ago the Department of Defense said that there were just seven US military staff in the country, and DMDC reports in March and June showed that there were fewer than 20. But the White House told Congress at the same time that there were 645 troops in the African country, but then revised the number up to 800 once the US losses became public, also revealing that the American counter-terrorism mission in the country had been going on for years. Whether the numbers stated now are the real ones, no one can actually tell.While fooling Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) is all well and good, those who appeared to be most misled are ordinary US citizens – and even some politicians – who are lied to on a daily basis by Pentagon officials repeatedly mentioning what they know to be phony figures, without ever giving disclaimers that they are doing this for the sake of operational secrecy.In August, Defense Secretary James Mattis confessed that he “inherited” a “very strange accounting procedure,” and the Pentagon promised that “this way of doing business is over,” but the newest data suggests that little has changed so far."
"Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, Trump said that he would be meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) later in the day, but that he was not optimistic about a deal to avoid a government shutdown.“Meeting with ‘Chuck and Nancy’ today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don’t see a deal!” he wrote.Meeting with “Chuck and Nancy” today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don’t see a deal!Both the House and Senate must pass a spending bill by December 8 to avoid the shutdown. A fight over immigration has complicated efforts to reach a deal.Schumer and Pelosi apparently abandoned plans to meet with Trump in the wake of the tweet, saying that “given that the president doesn’t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead,” AP reported.The major point of tension between the two sides is the Obama administration’s executive program giving legal protections to children of immigrants living in the US illegally, known as “Dreamers.” Trump scrapped the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), in September. If Congress doesn’t pass a law granting them legal status, “Dreamers” may face deportation next year.Democrats are demanding that any deal on funding the government include language providing protection for DACA recipients. Trump and Congressional Republicans have countered by pushing for funding of the wall along the border with Mexico.Republicans and Democrats are unlikely to agree on any legislation granting DACA recipients legal status. The GOP is looking to mandate an e-verify computer database, so employers can check the immigration status of applicants and avoid hiring workers who are in the US illegally. They are also seeking an end to the diversity lottery visa program, which currently allows 50,000 people a year to come into the US as permanent residents. Democrats, however, want to create a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, with demands to do the same for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.There had previously been talk of a short-term deal which could have funded the government for several weeks, giving the parties time to further negotiate a long-term deal for the rest of the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2018. Trump's tweet, however, appears to suggest such a solution is unlikely."
"The housekeeping staff that worked during Clinton’s tenure in the White House were “afraid to bend over in his presence,” Tripp told the Weekly Standard in a recent interview. She said that stories of Clinton’s ""libidinous impulses"" as governor of Arkansas were well-known even before his arrival in the White House in January 1993.The former White House employee was a central figure in exposing Clinton’s extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, then a 22-year-old White House intern. Tripp secretly recorded Lewinsky describing her relationship with the president – evidence that helped lead to Clinton’s impeachment in 1999. Clinton was acquitted of all charges and completed his term.Since exposing Clinton’s misconduct, Tripp has lived a quiet life in Northern Virginia, avoiding the limelight and publicity she received in the late 1990s. But Tripp says the recent spate of headlines about sexual assault and misconduct by powerful men has forced her to relive her trying experience.Commenting on how the press has become more critical of Clinton’s behavior over the years, Tripp told the Weekly Standard that she wasn’t impressed.“They have nothing to lose, and this is now permissible,” she said. “The fact that the Clintons are dead in the water gives [the media] tacit approval to act like human beings… It’s disingenuous. It’s a dollar late, and it’s a dollar short,” she added.Tripp is hardly alone in accusing Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Since entering politics in Arkansas in the 1980s, the former president has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and even rape.More than 15 years after leaving the White House, Clinton is still hounded by fresh allegations of extramarital, sexual trysts. Flight logs released last year show Clinton flew at least 26 times on the infamous ‘Lolita Express’ – a private jet owned by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Between 2001 and 2003, while Hillary was serving as a US senator, Bill took a number of “extended junkets” on Epstein’s plane, which reportedly had a bed in which passengers had group sex with girls as young as 12.Last year, an email that was apparently written by former secretary of state Colin Powell was released by hackers, claiming that Bill Clinton was “still dicking bimbos at home (according to the NYP)."""
"The 70-story building, located on Panama City’s waterfront, once paid at least $32 million to associate with Donald Trump. The 369-room condominium-hotel has been struggling with poor occupancy, however.The move to erase the president’s name and fire the hotel management followed the news that Trump was being paid to end a similar management contract for the Trump Soho hotel in New York.Owners push to strip Trump brand, end management deal at luxury 70-story Panama hotel. https://t.co/RqpLag9SAh“I bought there because I thought Trump’s name made it a safe investment,” Al Monstavicius, a retired Nevada doctor who owns a penthouse hotel unit in the Panama project told AP. “But Latinos are a real problem for him in Panama.”The Trump Organization acknowledged to AP the effort to strip away the Panama property’s management and brand. It said it believed the move was a contract violation.Owners of apartments and hotel units at the Panama property have previously complained about problems with Trump’s management. In October 2015, AP reported owners of apartments in the building had revolted over alleged mismanagement, firing Trump’s manager from the building’s overall board of directors. Trump threatened to sue but the claim was settled and Trump remained manager of the hotel component of the tower.“Not only do we have a valid, binding and enforceable long-term management agreement, but any suggestion that the hotel is not performing up to expectations is belied by the actual facts,” the Trump Organization said in a statement.The Panama move follows similar efforts at other buildings. Earlier this month, an apartment complex on Manhattan’s West Side stripped Trump’s name from its three buildings after complaints from residents. Close to 600 residents in the Trump Place apartment complex signed a “Dump the Trump name” petition, according to Bloomberg News. The building will use its street address instead.“We’re very pleased, people felt really good that they could do something,” Linda Gottlieb, one of the petition’s authors, told Bloomberg. “It was an empowering way to protest. It wasn’t a random protest, it was a very specific protest.”The name change was mutually agreed upon and “simply the enforcement of a pre-existing agreement which has been in place for years,” Amanda Miller, a Trump Organization vice president, told the news outlet in an email.Even before Trump was elected, a Dubai real estate firm building a $6 billion golf complex removed his name and image following a backlash over the presidential candidate’s proposal to “ban all Muslims” from entering the United States."

They call her Pocahontas.”Turning to the veterans, Trump added, “But, do you know what?

Warren has recently clashed with Trump over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She was one of the driving forces behind the agency’s establishment under the Obama administration. The agency is currently run by dueling directors, after Trump and the outgoing director both appointed people to run the consumer watchdog. Warren is also rumored to be a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.Pocahontas was an important historical figure, romanticized in the 1995 Disney animated feature. She was the daughter of Powhatan, the chief of a network of tribal nations in the territory called Tsenacommacah, today part of Virginia and Maryland. She was captured by English colonists in 1613 and held for ransom. During her captivity, she converted to Christianity and married a tobacco planter.Pocahontas was presented to British society in 1616 and became a celebrity. She died the following year, of unknown causes, and was buried in England. Numerous landmarks and products in the United States have been named after her."
"Mulvaney imposed new rules and a hiring freeze Monday, after taking over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) at the behest of President Donald Trump. Mulvaney took over the agency after former CFPB Director Richard Cordray left his role last week.However, former interim deputy director of the CFPB Laura English, who was appointed as temporary head of the agency by Cordray, filed a lawsuit in US District Court for the District of Washington late Sunday, against Mulvaney’s takeover.On Monday in Washington DC, English’s case was heard by Federal Judge Timothy J. Kelly, who was previously appointed by President Trump. After the case was heard, Judge Kelly ultimately declined to issue a temporary restraining order against Mulvaney, as was requested by English.Before Kelly’s decision Monday, Mulvaney said at a press conference that “elections have consequences at every agency, and that includes the CFPB,” the Los Angeles Times reported.Mulvaney also elaborated on his hiring freeze at the CFPB, adding: “Anything in the pipeline stops for at least 30 days.”Mulvaney was seen on Monday bringing donuts to his first day on the job at the CFPB.Mulvaney brings donuts to his first day at CFPB. Couldn’t hurt. pic.twitter.com/BpKJ2nd1L0Cordray had announced that he planned to resign his office by the end of November. He was appointed by President Barack Obama and has been long criticized by Congressional Republicans as overzealous. English's lawsuit calls on the Trump administration to block the appointment of Mulvaney as interim director. English is seeking an injunction ordering Trump to halt the Mulvaney appointment. The suit argued Mulvaney can’t be director because he already reports directly to the president.English argued there was a statutory conflict between the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act over who has the right to appoint an interim successor at the agency.“The President may not, consistent with the statutory requirement of independence, install a still-serving White House staffer as the acting head of an independent agency - particularly when doing so would displace an acting head who has a clear legal entitlement to the position,” the lawsuit said.The Trump administration retorted that there was no statutory conflict, and that the president had every authority to appoint the new agency head.“The law is clear: Director Mulvaney is the acting director of the CFPB,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.Public Citizen president Rob Weissman: Mick Mulvaney wants to come in and prevent the @CFPB from doing what it is intended to do. We must defend consumers and #DefendCFPB. pic.twitter.com/pQNTcR10JCCFPB’s general counsel, Mary McLeod, drafted a memo supporting the Trump administration’s position.“I advise all Bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that Director Mulvaney is the acting director of the CFPB,” McLeod wrote, according to the American Banker.The CFPB director is supposed to be shielded from politics because of the judicial and law enforcement functions of the job, which involve filing enforcement actions and deciding appeals. The CFPB get its funding from the Federal Reserve and its director is giving significant leverage to go after what he or she considers important.The Dodd-Frank Act, which created the CFPB, explicitly specified the role of the president. It states that the president can nominate a CFPB director who is confirmed by the Senate and can only fire the director “for cause.” It said nothing about the director resigning, however.Under the leadership of Cordray, its first director, the CFPB implemented and proposed new rules and regulations for the banking industry. The agency also took legal action against banks, mortgage companies, credit issuers, payday lenders, debt collectors and others, and extracted billions in settlement. When Wells Fargo was found to have opened millions of phony accounts for its customers, the CPFB fined the bank $100 million, the agency’s largest penalty to date."
"Titled “Federal Fumbles: 100 ways the government dropped the ball,” the report lists $473.6 billion in wasteful federal spending and includes 100 illustrations. It was released Monday by Senator James Lankford (R-Oklahoma).The report divided its wide range of subjects into four categories: wasteful spending, lack of oversight, the need for structural changes, and wasted effort.“This book is designed to be a reminder that we still have an issue with debt and deficit in America,” Lankford told the Senate media gallery. “If we’re going to manage our economy and spending better, there are specific ways to do it.”Watch the #FederalFumbles press conference LIVE at 11am ET/10am CT: https://t.co/ML3SIexatYOne of the examples of wasteful spending was an adaptation of a Shakespeare play featuring animal actors. Titled ‘Doggie Hamlet,’ the New Hampshire performance was funded by $30,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts. The play apparently did not live up to expectations.“The adaptation does not include any actual lines from Hamlet, is conducted outdoors in a 30-by-50-foot field in New Hampshire, and is mostly humans yelling or running toward confused sheep and dogs,” the report says.Another section complained that the National Science Foundation “provided six grants totaling $2.6 million to study how stickleback adapts to different environments.” The stickleback is a family of fish related to pipefish and seahorses.The report earned high praise from the White Coat Waste Project, a taxpayer watchdog focused on exposing and ending federal spending on wasteful and cruel animal experiments.""Sen. Lankford’s Federal Fumbles report is an essential playbook for ending reckless spending and increasing government’s accountability to taxpayers who are being unwittingly forced to pay countless billions for wasteful projects including mouse fight clubs, breeding narcoleptic Dobermans and getting monkeys hooked on nicotine,” said the project's founder and president, Anthony Bellotti.Lankford also took aim at a Department of Transportation program that gave more than $1 billion to expand the San Diego, California trolley line by 10 miles. That money “could have paid for a 100- to 250-mile-long four-lane highway,” the report claims.The report gives multiple examples of wasteful spending by the Pentagon. In the section titled “Dude, where’s my truck?” Lankford cited the Department of Defense report that revealed “the department is unable to track down more than $1 billion in equipment purchased for Iraqi security forces” from 2015-16. The report says the Pentagon “did not have accurate, up-to-date records on the quantity and location” of the military equipment.In 2015, Iraq admitted that Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) jihadists captured huge caches of US-made weapons, including thousands of Humvees, from Iraqi forces retreating from Mosul. The spoils of war were then been used by IS to gain ground in Iraq and Syria.Lankford also accused the military of wasting money on the newest fighter jet intended for all three service branches. “Delays and poor planning have caused the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to be years late and at a cost of $400 billion, with the most recent delay potentially costing $1.7 billion,” the report says.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in October, stating that the DoD’s F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) is “facing sustainment challenges that are affecting warfighter readiness.” The review said the Pentagon’s ability to repair F-35 parts at military depots was six years behind schedule, resulting in an average repair time of 172 days, twice the program’s objective.Lankford cited transportation, defense and disaster relief as “essential things” the US government needs to spend money on."
"“Fox News is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!” Trump said in yet another tweet that resonated around the world..@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!This is not the first time the US cable news channel, which rarely reports favorably on the current president, has heard such criticism.In August, when CNN’s Jim Acosta asked Trump during a White House press conference why he didn’t condemn hate groups, Trump snapped back, “they have been condemned.”When Acosta pushed Trump on the question, the president said, “I like real news, not fake news. You’re fake news,” before exiting the room.However, the latest Trump attack on CNN attracted some heavyweights into the shouting match, including former CIA and National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden.On Sunday morning, Hayden tweeted his dismay with Trump’s comments, going so far as to suggest his career has been “wasted.”“If this is who we are or who we are becoming, I have wasted 40 years of my life,” Hayden said. If this is who we are or who we are becoming, I have wasted 40 years of my life.   Until now it was not possible for me to conceive of an American President capable of such an outrageous assault on truth, a free press or the first amendment.There is no love lost between Hayden and Trump, who have been at loggerheads over everything from Hillary Clinton’s missing emails to Trump’s controversial decision to bar Muslim immigrants from entering the U.S. The two also sparred after Trump chastised NFL football players who opted to ‘take a knee’ during the National Anthem to protest police brutality.“The president had created what logicians call a false dilemma, that support for free speech or for teammates equated to disrespect for flag, anthem or country. And he did it for political advantage,” Hayden wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill.Journalist Glenn Greenwald couldn’t resist an opportunity to take a dig at the former intelligence chief, who was once criticized for lying to the media over the NSA’s surveillance of American citizens.The outpouring of support for George W. Bush's CIA & NSA chief - who oversaw torture, rendition, illegal domestic spying and an array of other evils - is so moving: ""No, General Hayden, your career was not wasted!"" https://t.co/Q1A2S7TT68Meanwhile, in his latest tweet on the subject of CNN, Trump suggested we have a “contest” to determine which of the coverage of “your favorite President (me)” is the most “dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted.”""Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!"" the US leader wrote.We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!The heated remarks from Trump come as CNN posted comments by former US attorney Preet Bharara, who said Sunday that it was ""likely"" Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is in discussions with special counsel Robert Mueller about cooperating with his ongoing investigation into so-called 'Russian meddling' in last year's election.Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia in the course of the campaign, which saw the New York real estate developer emerge victorious in a hotly contested election. Despite months of talk about ""Russian meddling"" by US media organizations like CNN, no evidence has ever been produced to prove the claim."
"“I did think she was very dangerous,” Sarandon said in an interview with The Guardian, as she continues to attract criticism from Clinton loyalists over her support for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and her subsequent vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein during the 2016 election.“I got from Hillary people, ‘I hope your crotch is grabbed’, ‘I hope you’re raped.’ Misogynistic attacks,"" she said.When you love Susan Sarandon’s work but can’t forgive her cause she’s the reason why Trump is prez. pic.twitter.com/AGUq3dlOuB.@DebraMessing .@JasonGanwich .@SusanSarandon Susan can suck it she helped elect this racist & I hope her pussy gets grabbed 24/7Asked if Clinton was more dangerous than Trump, Sarandon explained, “I did think she was very, very dangerous. We would still be fracking, we would be at war [if she was president]. It wouldn’t be much smoother. Look what happened under [Barack] Obama that we didn’t notice.”Clinton has a long record of supporting US interventions. Her vote for the Iraq war, the zeal with which she pushed to take down Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, down to her giddy celebration at his death, are just some of the reasons pacifists chose not to vote for her.While Trump has failed to end US interventionism since coming to power, Clinton had advocated for a no-fly-zone over Syria, which would have likely led to war between the US, and Syria and Russia. Clinton admitted a no-fly-zone would “kill a lot of Syrians,” in a 2013 speech leaked by WikiLeaks before the election. She also maintains a hawkish stance on Iran, and promised in 2008, “If I’m president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them.”Sarandon voted for Stein in New York, which, she explains “was probably the easiest place to vote for Stein,” as Trump was not going to win that state. “Bringing attention to working-class issues is not a luxury,” she said of her decision. “People are really hurting; that’s how this guy got in.”Syria no-fly zone would mean ‘killing a lot of Syrians’ – leaked Clinton speechhttps://t.co/lCCZIxo61Vpic.twitter.com/68QqTAw4BE“It wasn’t a protest vote,” she added. “Following Bernie wasn’t a protest.” Aside from a pro-war stance, the former secretary of state’s apparent inability to understand the anger felt by Americans still living with the effects of the global financial crisis, and her centrist policies meant she was not a viable candidate for Sarandon and others – even with the threat of a Trump presidency. Sarandon highlighted Clinton’s refusal to back a $15 minimum wage as being the stance of a non-feminist.Sarandon thinks the blame levied at her over Clinton’s loss is part of the reason Democrats will lose again. “Well, that’s why we’re going to lose again if we depend on the DNC [the Democratic National Committee],” she said. “Because the amount of denial ... I mean it’s very flattering to think that I, on my own, cost the election. That my little voice was the deciding factor.”#DonnaBrazile blasts ‘cancer’ of Clinton campaign’s stranglehold on DNC https://t.co/MuAn9asFBVpic.twitter.com/XNPSck5cyd“It’s upsetting to me more from the point of view of thinking they haven’t learned,” she added.Sarandon also pointed to the fact that, “you can’t judge by the mainstream media what’s going on in the country,” a quote which The Guardian placed inside parentheses and described as “the space where the extreme right meets the left.”“How did we lose all our journalists and media?” she asked."
"The US President took to his favored platform, Twitter, to lambast Jones, saying “Jones would be a disaster!” if elected to office. His opponent in the race has been embroiled in scandal following accusations in the Washington Post that he initiated a sexual encounter with a 14 year-old girl in 1979. Moore was 32 at the time.The Post further reported that three other women, then aged between 16 and 18, now also allege that Moore, described as a ‘firebrand judge’, pursued them when he was in his early thirties.The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough. Can’t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!Moore has lost nearly all support within the party, but Trump appears to be sticking by his man, despite campaigning for his opponent, incumbent Senator “Big Luther” Strange, in the runoff Republican primary.Multiple high-level Republicans have called on Moore to drop out of the race but he, so far, hasn’t heeded their advice. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) told reporters that Moore should be expelled from the Senate even if he wins the upcoming December 12 special election. Other Senators took to Sunday TV programmes to criticise their president’s apparent support for Moore.Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), said “that’s a political decision by the president and he’s definitely trying to throw a lifeline to Roy Moore.” “From a Republican point of view, I don’t know what winning looks like with Roy Moore,” he added.Meanwhile on NBC’s Meet the Press, fellow Republican Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), said that the best thing for the country would be if Moore dropped out. “I think that'd be better for the country and, you know, the election’s in a few weeks here, or in a couple weeks maybe, and, you know, there is a possibility for folks to do write-in candidates, so we’ll see but, no, I think it’d be best if he stepped aside,” he said."
"The US Defense Department plans to announce as early as Monday that around 2,000 US troops are currently deployed in Syria, two American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters Friday.The United States has repeatedly refused to acknowledge the number of troops and “military advisers” it has fighting alongside the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Syria. During Barack Obama’s presidency, the US military routinely announced foreign troop deployments, but the Trump administration stopped disclosing such information about Operation Inherent Resolve. The policy was reversed in the spring, to keep up the “element of surprise” against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists in both Syria and Iraq.“In order to maintain tactical surprise, ensure operational security and force protection, the coalition will not routinely announce or confirm information about the capabilities, force numbers, locations, or movement of forces in or out of Iraq and Syria,” said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon at the time.But with the fight against ISIS seemingly winding down, reporters began questioning the number of US servicemen deployed in Syria. The figure appears to be so secretive, that even James B. Jarrard, who heads the US-led Special Operations task force, stumbled when pressed to come up with a definitive answer recently.At first, Jarrard said there were 5,000 US troops in the region, but immediately corrected himself, lowering the figure to 4,000. After being grilled by the press, he then dramatically reduced the number to “approximately 500 troops.”Confusion surrounding the actual number of soldiers deployed abroad is as a result of the management system Washington uses to cap numbers of American soldiers serving overseas. The Obama Administration used the Force Management Level (FML) system for managing the US military presence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The FML capped the US troop presence in Iraq at 5,262 and in Syria at 503. The Trump Administration, however, delegated authority to establish troop caps for Iraq and Syria to the Secretary of Defense, instead of the United States Department of Defense (DoD).No more ‘fighting ISIS?’ US to stay in Syria to prevent ‘win’ for Assad and Iran – WaPo https://t.co/U6F0xy9j3Zpic.twitter.com/du0oehP4JPWashington’s military engagement in Syria has repeatedly been branded “illegitimate” by Damascus, which views the US presence in its country as an anti-government intervention. Reports suggest, however, that the US is not planning to leave any time soon. Just on Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that the US wants to keep its troops in Syria long after Islamic State terrorists is defeated to help the SDF establish “new local governance” structures while preventing complete victory by the Syrian government and its ally, Iran.'Strategic interest': US will remain in Syria for decades after #ISIS defeated – Kurdish militia allies https://t.co/GEXHwwzcz3pic.twitter.com/q8z17U4ZIg"
"Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!TIME Magazine denied Trump’s assertion Friday that the publication called him to tell him he was, in all caps, “PROBABLY” going to be bestowed the annual honor of Person of the Year for the second time in a row.The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6.Whatever measure of truth or falsity Trump’s tweet had, the redeeming value for the president in these situations seems to lie in the reactions across social media and TV coverage. TIME’s Person of the Year quickly became a top trend on Twitter. Trump's fans tweeted lavishing adoration, while those against him spewed venom.Some in the media sought to get all the facts straight. Others simply altered Trump’s style as their own, in more obviously sarcastic bromides.Called @TIME for comment on this. FYI, this sounds like part of the normal Person of the Year production process https://t.co/HNzFW1pqzfTime magazine also called me to say I was going to be person of the year but I was busy that day tooIn case anyone is wondering I, too, turned down Time Person of the Year. https://t.co/TSy8xLganCFYI, I, too, have turned down being this year’s Time Person of the Year - who needs the hassle?Still, other NeverTrump personalities took the president’s tweet as an opportunity to bring up RussiaGate or praise special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump’s perceived arch-nemesis.My prediction: Time Magazine found someone even better to be Person of the Year#MuellerTimepic.twitter.com/LinKTnl441I don’t know who’ll be Time’s 2017 Person of the Year, but I must say it would be nice if Robert Mueller turns out to be Time’s 2018 Person of the Year.TIME completed a photoshoot with Trump in November last year, and announced him as Person of the Year in the first week of December. The magazine’s process for selecting a winning candidate is relatively secret, but there is an online poll that is currently active.Trump is presently tied in second place in the TIME Person of the Year poll, but so are two other contenders, and they each have only 5 percent. The only aspirant with any substantial voter support appears to be Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with 21 percent.Behind Trump were “the Dreamers,” illegal immigrants brought to the US as children, the hashtag #MeToo, as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, singer Taylor Swift, Russian President Vladimir Putin and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Other names garnered 4 percent or less at the time of writing."
"Friday morning’s blast at the Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, northern Sinai, prompted worshippers to flee the building, scrambling for their lives.

We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will. Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt.Earlier in the day, Trump described the attack as “horrible and cowardly” and its victims as “innocent and defenseless worshipers.”“The world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!” the president said.Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt. The world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!Building a wall along the US border with Mexico to crack down on illegal immigration has been one of Trump’s core campaign promises. Congress has since earmarked $10 billion for border security, and a number of wall prototypes have been built in San Diego, California. Opponents of the wall have resorted to creative gimmicks to hinder its construction.Since taking office, Trump has issued three executive orders attempting to restrict entry into the US to citizens of specific countries. The third and most recent order applies to residents of Iran, Chad, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea and government officials from Venezuela, citing security reasons.Trump’s critics have contested the travel bans as discriminatory against Muslims, citing his campaign trail statement about a “total and complete ban on Muslims entering the US” as proof of his intent. The US Supreme Court is expected to make a decision on the ban at some point during its current session."
"Texas-based company AirTronic USA has been selling grenade launchers to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, VOA said in its report, citing the company CEO Richard Vandiver. The company head told the media outlet that his firm began cooperating with Kiev as early as two years ago while the first arms deliveries were made in 2016.“We started to deliver our goods to Ukraine last year [and] we continue to deliver them up to this day,” Vandiver said. He refused to provide any further details concerning the contract but said that the US embassy in Kiev, as well as the State Department and the Pentagon, closely monitor the issue. The businessman also added that his company obtained an official export license for its weapons from the State Department.The PSRL grenade launchers that AirTronic USA has been to Kiev in fact a redesigned US-manufactured version of the Soviet RPG-7, which the US company itself calls “the world’s most widely used anti-tank weapon.”The supply agreement was initially renewed annually but is now not limited by time, Vandiver said, claiming that the US embassy now controls how the grenade launchers are used by Ukrainian troops. The contract specifically prohibits resale of the weapons.Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Valery Chaly admitted to VOA that Ukrainian diplomats had played a certain role in this deal. “We established contacts between the AirTronic USA and the Ukroboronprom [the state-owned Ukrainian defense industry enterprise that manages arms production and arms trade] at some point and then they developed this cooperation further,” he said, calling the contract “a political decision.”In the meantime, Vandiver said that the weapons his company supplies to Ukraine are purely of a “defensive” nature and thus do not violate any international agreements – even the Minsk Accords. However, he did acknowledge that it is a “lethal weapons system,” adding that the grenade launchers have a maximum range of 1,000 meters.The news comes just two weeks after the US Congress approved the draft of the national defense budget that authorizes $350 million to provide security aid to Ukraine to “provide security assistance … including defensive lethal assistance.” The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) also contains an entire category entitled ‘Countering Russian Aggression’.Under this category, the US plans to spend as much as $4.6 billion on what it calls the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) aimed at “reassuring NATO allies and enhancing the US deterrent and defense postures in Europe.” In particular, the NDAA envisages allocations of $100 million in military aid to the Baltic countries.Russia has repeatedly criticized the US plans to send lethal weapons to Kiev, calling them a potential threat to stability in Ukraine, as well as neighboring countries. In particular, Moscow warned that the move could encourage Kiev to renew a full-out war in Donbass in an attempt to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine."
"“Six F-22 fighters from the US Air Force are scheduled to join the joint South Korea-U.S. air force exercise Vigilant Ace from Dec. 4-8,” South Korean military officials told Yonhap. The date of the air drills was also confirmed by Reuters.Last year, more than 16,000 servicemen took part in the annual exercise, which involved more than 200 US aircraft, including, F-16 Fighting Falcons, A-10 Thunderbolts II, EA-18G Growlers, F/A-18D Hornets, C-130 Hercules’, KC-135 Stratotankers and an E-3B Airborne Warning and Control System. This year, under Donald Trump’s leadership, the Americans are sending their top of the range fighter aircraft to project its power over Korean airspace. F-22 fighters will reportedly be joined by up to four F-35A Lightning jets from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa to exert maximum pressure on North Korea, Yonhap sources noted.During Vigilant Ace drills, the US fighters will reportedly practice “enemy infiltration” and engage in “precision strike drills” with their South Korean counterparts.Trump has made it his administration’s priority to stop North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, which have accelerated under the leadership of Kim Jong-un. The US plan, thus far, has focused on harsh economic measures adopted against North Korea. While diplomacy still dictates the rules of engagement between Pyongyang and Washington, both capitals are not shying away from belligerent rhetoric and mutual threats of nuclear armageddon.North Korea has repeatedly protested over the American military buildup in the region out of fear that Washington, Seoul and Tokyo might attack Pyongyang. The isolated state has also consistently condemned all US-led military drills in the region.'North Korea is a hell no person deserves' - #Trump delivers yet another message of warning to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un pic.twitter.com/6v1s5ituvZJust this month, in the latest show of American muscle in the region, three US carrier strike groups held tri-carrier, multinational drills off the Korean coast. The USS Ronald Reagan, USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt were joined by Japan’s Ise, Inazuma and Makinami vessels, as well as near a dozen South Korean ships. North Korea furiously condemned the maneuvers, which also involved US B-1 strategic bombers.Washington “is now running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean Peninsula, thereby proving that the US itself is the major offender of the escalation of tension and undermining of the peace,” Ja Song Nam, North Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations, said in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this month."
"Raytheon and Boeing are the two defense contractors selected to produce precision-guided munitions for the Saudi Arabian military, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The deal is part of the giant $110-billion weapons agreement inked by Trump and the Saudi king Salman bin Abdulaziz in May.Neither the corporations nor Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman, chose to comment on the precision weapons sale. The Saudi diplomat said, however, that his country will follow the agreement signed by Trump and King Salman.Under the terms of the deal, Saudi Arabia will take delivery of US-made tanks, artillery, helicopters and light close air support as well as intelligence-gathering aircraft, and anti-missile systems such as Patriot and THAAD. The Trump administration has aggressively pushed for the arms deal, citing the revenue it would generate for the US economy as well as the numerous jobs it would create in the defense industry.Arms sales to Saudi Arabia have caused widespread controversy internationally. Since 2015, the Sunni monarchy has been waging a war against Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen, which pushed one of the Arab world’s poorest countries to the brink of famine and left some 4,800 Yemenis killed. Most of the civilian casualties were caused by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, though Riyadh consistently denied the reports.Rights groups say coalition airstrikes have deliberately targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure on multiple occasions, indicating that the problem lies in the Saudi-led-coalition’s rules of engagement rather than non-possession of better and more precise arms.READ MORE: US lawmakers seek to reverse Trump’s $110bn arms deal with Saudi ArabiaThe specifics of the precision weapons deal have not been disclosed, but it is known that Raytheon has long been producing the Paveway IV laser-guided bombs, marketed as munitions meant to revolutionize “tactical air-to-ground warfare by converting ‘dumb’ bombs into precision guided munitions.” Another Raytheon product, the Excalibur precision artillery shell, is in use with the US, Swedish, Canadian, Australian and Dutch militaries.Boeing, one of the world’s leading aircraft builders, is also known as the manufacturer of “smart” bombs called Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). It also produces so-called JDAM kits used to convert general purpose bombs into laser- or GPS-guided weapons. The US State Department has yet to formally notify Congress of the precision guided munitions deal. Washington has promised to take into account “regional balance and human rights as well as the impact on the US defense industrial base,” according to an unnamed State Department official."
"The service members all worked for the White House Communications Agency, a specialized military unit that helps provide the president, vice president, Secret Service and other officials with secure communications, the Washington Post reported citing unnamed officials.Oops: White House Military Personnel May Have Had “Improper Contact” with “Foreign Women” During Trump's Asia Trip… https://t.co/0yjfaR3JqSThe incident was said to have happened during Trump’s visit to Vietnam earlier this month, when the three US Army noncommissioned officers allegedly broke curfew. Vietnam was one of the stops on Trump’s 12-day Asia tour.“We are aware of the incident, and it is currently under investigation,” Mark Wright, a spokesman for the defense department, told Reuters.Service members with high-level security clearances are expected to report contacts with foreign individuals to ensure their interactions do not compromise national security. The three NCOs face the risk of losing their security clearances and could be subject to administrative discipline or courts-martial.The mission of the agency is to prevent eavesdropping on presidential communications and to ensure the White House officials can be securely reached worldwide at a moment’s notice.White House military personnel removed amid inquiry into contacts with foreign women https://t.co/rkBqXZWAAtpic.twitter.com/sI2XMavZy1The episode comes after four military personnel on the same White House team faced allegations related to their behavior during a trip to Panama in August with VicePresident Mike Pence. Those men ‒ two from the Army and two from the Air Force ‒ stand accused of taking foreign women after hours into a secure areas as they prepared for Pence’s arrival, officials said.They were all flown home before Pence arrived and stripped of their White House assignments pending the findings of the investigation, the Post reported. There is no indication at this point that the women who were brought to the hotel were prostitutes, officials said.Army Colonel Amanda Azubuike told Stars and Stripes an investigation into the Panama case has been closed and the findings forwarded to senior military officials for review. She said she was not aware of the final conclusions or any disciplinary action."
"In a confidential US State Department memo, reported first by Reuters, Rex Tillerson reportedly breached the Child Soldiers Prevention Act when he decided in June to exclude Afghanistan, Iraq, and Myanmar from a list of states known to employ child soldiers.‘Is that why Americans are fighting and risking their lives in Afghanistan – to make the world safe for pedophilia?’ – ex-diplomat https://t.co/fIxkZCMZtCRT:  Why do you think Rex Tillerson decided to take Afghanistan, Iraq, and Myanmar off the list of countries using child soldiers? Does this make it easier for the US to cooperate with the militaries of these countries?Jennifer Breedon: It does make it (easier), but unfortunately Rex Tillerson in his capacity of secretary of state has actually been directly going against President Trump in a lot of the things he stated. One such thing – he stated many times in his platform…about the stand against these countries that are utilizing child soldiers, and we’re not supposed to be able to provide military support or even training.But essentially if we allow military training of countries that we know have child soldiers, we’re essentially helping to train those very children that have become child soldiers. We have seen this time and time again, where President Trump has stated something in his foreign policy and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has gone against it. I don’t know if this is some kind of stance, or if he is just sort of laughing behind the President of the US, but it’s really showing a destabilization from the US foreign policy standpoint.One such example - and this correlates directly with the child soldiers – is the UN speech. President Trump gave a UN speech in September of this year, talking about the self-determination of nations and how he wanted to go against certain people that were proxies, tied to the Iranian regime. Regardless of the stance, Rex Tillerson went completely against everything Trump said. He helped the PMF (Popular Mobilization Forces) and the Hashd al-Shaabi in Iraq, and he has continued to do this almost in direct defiance of President Trump.'Nothing could be done about child sexual abuse, it was not a priority for the command' – report https://t.co/0KG7kOzC0uRT:   Why did Tillerson make this decision, despite the State Department acknowledging those countries use children in their armed forces?JB: And that’s the worst part, because the head of the State Department, essentially the head of our entire US foreign policy, Tillerson has an obligation to listen and to utilize the people within the State Department that have been there, and to adhere to their reports, and to what they have said. Unfortunately, it seems like he’s kind of going rogue on this and just thinks that he can do better.This is the guy who was a businessman – he worked for Exxon – and he’s done all kinds of deals with nations. So if Rex Tillerson is somebody who is only looking at money, and who cares more about money – whether that would be US military contracts or other things with these countries - then human rights of children that are being forced to become child soldiers to take part in these violent battles, then we have a real problem – when the leader of foreign policy cares more about these military or financial deals than he does the human lives of these people.US forces in Afghanistan allegedly open fire on stone-throwing children in eastern Afghanistan https://t.co/O2m3gwCC37pic.twitter.com/r4TEgoj2TZRT:   Can we assume there is some kind of internal split within the US State Department? How far could this go?JB: Absolutely. I think that’s been a consistent problem at the State Department, and with this new information unfolding, we’re going to see that more, that there is a split. One of the most important things for any nation – especially a powerful nation – is that there is unification among the people in power and among the leadership.You’ve seen a split now: you have top State Department officials coming out and disagreeing with Tillerson’s decision to arm these child soldiers. We’ve seen this before in the State Department when they’ve written letters, they have expressed their disconcerting feelings about what the department, what the secretary of state is doing.So not only is there a split within the State Department, but there is also a very heavy, deep partisan split within the US and a split between President Trump himself and Tillerson. So Rex Tillerson seems to be splitting with not only the president, but his very own State Department, which he is opposed to adhere to, and listen to some of their reports.BREAKING: Tillerson, Mattis urge Congress not to repeal 2001 war authority https://t.co/p480bRmiaM#AUMFpic.twitter.com/2IdSuRBW3MRT:   The US State Department spokeswoman claimed some of the countries had only one report of a child soldier. Does that make it reasonable to remove them?JB: It depends on the situation – I always say this. I am somebody who is a human rights attorney, and as such we always have to look at the situation. For example, there are some countries – such as Afghanistan and others - where terrorism from the Taliban and others have become so bad that it is mainstream. And there are some people that are maybe 16-17 years old that choose to put their studies on hold and with their parents’ consent want to go and fight in the military. Under legal terms, they would be considered child soldiers.Again, if this is the one instance that you’re looking at, where this was a child that was between 16, 17 years old that wanted to help because the village was unable to live in, then that is a very different situation, than if there were many things happening or this was a six-year-old child that has been forced into military combat. So, as you stated, if there is one – it depends on the situation. If we look at it reasonably, rather than just black and white saying “there is one instance, we’ll never do business with you,” or “what is that one instance?” That is what we need to see more often in the State Department is – what is the instance; can we help these countries?"
"During a State Department press briefing on Tuesday, Nauert was asked about Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab. Zarrab was arrested in the US back in 2016 and was later charged with money laundering and evading US sanctions on Iran. His trial will start in late November. The Turkish government says that the case against the businessman is a “clear plot against Turkey.” The journalists then asked “at what point” the “war of words” between Ankara and Washington would prompt the US to reassess relations with Turkey.“Well, as we’ve seen this year, there are some countries where we have – our relationship with these countries can ebb and flow sometimes,” Nauert said. “You have – like a marriage. You have a good day and sometimes you have a bad day, right?” she explained, prompting laughter among the journalists at the briefing. The State Department spokeswoman insisted that Ankara is “a valued ally of the US.” “We have had a strong relationship with Turkey. But really, just making comments about the United States trying to foment a coup is just – is simply ridiculous,” she added.On Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at Washington, comparing the case against Zarrab to the 2013 plot against government ministers and top businessmen. Ankara claims that the 2013 plot was carried out by the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) – led by Turkish preacher Fethullah Gulen, who has been living in the US since 1999. Turkey says Gulen attempted to create a “parallel state” in Turkey in the form of a network of supporters among Turkish officials. Turkey has repeatedly requested that the US extradite the preacher back to Turkey. The US has so far ignored the calls."
"Over 350,000 people walk across Times Square each day, one of the busiest pedestrian zones in the world. It will only get busier on New Year’s Eve, when up to a million people will go to watch the countdown. They might also catch a glimpse of the billboards paid for by billionaire Democratic Party donor Tom Steyer. The billboards direct their viewers to Steyer’s website, needtoimpeach.com, where they can sign a petition asking Congress to take action against the Commander-in-Chief.“We’re putting a couple of large billboards in Times Square calling for the impeachment of the president,” Steyer, who put $20mn toward the campaign, told Bloomberg on Monday. “We legitimately feel that this is the huge issue in front of the American people that no one is standing up for what the overwhelming number of Americans think.”READ MORE: Petition to impeach Trump reaches over 1mn signaturesSteyer, a former hedge fund manager who has since turned his focus to environmentalist causes like fighting climate change, has already run a series of TV ads in which he called the Trump administration a “clear and present danger” that threatens to drag the United States into a nuclear war. The ads ran on Fox News’ Fox & Friends show, known to be a favorite program of the president, prompting a response.“Wacky & totally unhinged,” was how Trump described Steyer on Twitter.Wacky & totally unhinged Tom Steyer, who has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from beginning, never wins elections!Although over 2,650,000 have signed the petition for Trump’s impeachment so far, senior Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi have reportedly told Steyer that they consider his campaign a distraction from the party’s overall political strategy.“It seems as if elected officials don’t think this is the time or don’t think that it’s tactically smart,” he said. “We’re not trying to be tactically smart. We’re not trying to in some way, shape or form… this for the [2018] midterms.”Opponents of Trump’s controversial presidency have long called for his impeachment, accusing him of colluding with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election campaign, among other things. However, no clear or definitive evidence of such collusion has yet been found.Last week, six Democrats in the House of Representatives, including two sitting on the House Judiciary Committee, introduced articles of impeachment. They singled out five of President Trump’s acts which they believe to be impeachment-worthy, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey."

"The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) unveiled the latest round of sanctions against China and North Korea Tuesday. Notable targets include Chinese businessmen and firms that export to Pyongyang, North Korean shipping companies and organizations that facilitate the movement of North Korean workers.“As North Korea continues to threaten international peace and security, we are steadfast in our determination to maximize economic pressure to isolate it from outside sources of trade and revenue while exposing its evasive tactics,” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement. “These designations include companies that have engaged in trade with North Korea cumulatively worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We are also sanctioning the shipping and transportation companies, and their vessels, that facilitate North Korea’s trade and its deceptive maneuvers.”Treasury sanctions trading, labor, and shipping companies and vesselsto further isolate North Korea and disrupt illicit funding of its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Targets include one individual, 13 entities, and 20 vessels: https://t.co/CT9hMx3d6pThe Chinese firms targeted by the US’ latest punitive measures include Dandong Kehua Economy & Trade Co. Ltd., Dandong Xianghe Trading Co. Ltd. and Dandong Hongda Trade Co. Ltd.“These three companies cumulatively exported approximately $650 million worth of goods to North Korea and cumulatively imported more than $100 million worth of goods from North Korea,” the OFAC said.The US also sanctioned Chinese businessman Sun Sidong and his company, Dandong Dongyuan Industrial Co. Ltd, alleging that they exported “$28 million worth of goods to North Korea over several years, including motor vehicles, electrical machinery, radio navigational items, aluminum, iron, pipes, and items associated with nuclear reactors.” OFAC claims that “Dongyuan has also been associated with front companies for weapons of mass destruction-related North Korean organizations.”The Maritime Administration of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), the Ministry of Land and Maritime Transportation and six shipping companies also found themselves in Washington’s crosshairs. The Treasury accused Pyongyang of engaging in “deceptive shipping practices” and included a photo of cargo ships involved in ship-to-ship transfers, “possibly of oil, in an effort to evade sanctions.”Rounding off Tuesday’s sanctions announcement was the Korea South-South Cooperation Corporation which has sent North Korean guest workers to China, Russia, Cambodia, and Poland.President Trump has threatened to launch a military attack aimed at toppling the government in Pyongyang, saying the country would face “fire and fury like the world has never seen.” In September the US and South Korea conducted joint naval exercises in the eastern and western waters off the Korean Peninsula.North Korea has proposed suspending its nuclear tests if the United States and South Korea cease their joint war games that simulate the invasion and occupation of the DPRK, the “decapitation” of its leadership, and a nuclear first strike against North Korea. The US has refused to do so."
"On Monday evening, BuzzFeed published a report that Representative John Conyers Jr (D-Michigan) settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015; with a former employee who said she was fired for refusing his sexual advances and “blackballed” into accepting a settlement of $27,000.Reached at his Detroit home, Conyers told AP that he had not settled any sexual harassment complaints with any staff members, and that he knows nothing about any claims of inappropriate touching. Commenting on sexual harassment claims against politicians and celebrities, he said he has “been looking at these things with amazement.”An icon of the civil rights movement, Conyers was first elected to Congress in 1964. He is currently the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. His case is just one of 264 settlements amounting to $17 million paid out by Congress’s Office of Compliance for various violations, including sexual harassment, over the past 20 years.President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that he favors releasing the names of those implicated in the settlements to the public.The Conyers settlement was 1 out of...264!How about you ""journalists"" stop hating on me and go find those other 263?Right-wing activist Mike Cernovich wrote that he tipped off BuzzFeed News to the Conyers case, in order to force the Congressional leadership and the Democrats to respond to the allegations, rather than “cover up these horrific sex crimes by powerful members of Congress” by attacking him personally.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) called the report “extremely troubling,” without bringing up Conyers by name.“Last month, I directed the Committee on House Administration to conduct a full review of all policies and procedures related to workplace harassment and discrimination. A Committee hearing last week examining this issue led to a new policy of mandatory training for all members and staff. Additional reforms to the system are under consideration as the committee continues its review,” Ryan said.Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California) called for an investigation into the validity of the report.""The reports about Congressman Conyers are as serious as they get,” Lofgren said in a statement. “The Committee on Ethics should take up this matter immediately with a goal of promptly assessing the validity of the news account. This reported behavior cannot be tolerated in the House of Representatives or anywhere else.""Conyers is among the most senior public officials to be implicated in the wave of sex scandals that have continued to break since actor Rose McGowan said she was raped by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-California) has called sexual harassment on Capitol Hill an “occupational hazard.” Last month, Speier shared her own story about being forcibly kissed by a Congressional chief of staff while she was working as a staffer.On Monday, Congresswoman Diana DeGette (D-Colorado) accused her former colleague Bob Filner (D-California) of sexually assaulting her in an elevator. Filner served in the House between 1993 and 2012. He then became mayor of San Diego, but resigned in August 2013 after 20 women accused him of groping, inappropriate touching and forcible kissing.Earlier this month, the Washington Post published accusations against Roy Moore, the Republican candidate in the upcoming special election for a US Senate seat in Alabama. The Post has endorsed Moore’s opponent, the Democrat Doug Jones. Moore has rejected all allegations as a political smear job and refused to drop out of the race.Last week, a radio broadcaster alleged that Senator Al Franken (D-Minnesota) kissed and groped her without consent during a USO tour of the Middle East in 2006. On Monday, another woman accused Franken of sexually harassing her in 2010. Franken has apologized but said he does not intend to resign from the Senate."
"The 62-year-old, with an estimated wealth of $11.1 billion, has never hidden his political leanings, jumping straight into Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign long before she officially announced her candidacy. In one of John Podesta's leaked emails, the long-time Clinton confidant and chairman of her presidential campaign told her soon-to-be campaign manager Robby Mook that he had met with Schmidt in April 2014, more than a year before Clinton told the American public that she was hoping to become their next president.""I met with Eric Schmidt tonight… He's ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc. He clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn't seem like he wanted to push others out. Clearly wants to get going. He's still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon. I think it's worth doing..."" Podesta wrote in the email, which was published by WikiLeaks last October. Another email, written two weeks later, showed Schmidt sharing his campaign ideas with Clinton aide Cheryl Mills. ""Let's assume a total budget of about $1.5 billion, with more than 5,000 paid employees and million(s) of volunteers,"" he said. He went on to brainstorm ideas on how to utilize technology in the campaign. It wasn't long before  The Groundwork, founded by analysts and engineers who worked on Barack Obama's campaign and funded by Schmidt, became Clinton's top technology provider. The Groundwork was housed in an office just a few blocks away from Clinton’s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.Schmidt continued to advise Clinton on digital matters throughout the campaign.""Eric recognizes how the technology he's been building his whole career can be applied to different spaces. The idea of tech as a force multiplier is something he deeply understands,"" The Groundwork's Michael Slaby told Quartz in 2015.Then there was campaign night, when a photo forwarded to Politico showed a smiling Schmidt at Clinton's election headquarters, complete with a ""staff"" badge.Schmidt's efforts to get Clinton elected, along with Google's overall efforts to do the same, were addressed in a November 2016 report by the Campaign for Accountability ‒ a non-partisan, non-profit organization that aims to expose misconduct and malfeasance in public life ‒ and its Google Transparency Project. The document concluded that ""Google executives and employees bet heavily on a Clinton victory, hoping to extend the company's influence on the White House."" It added that ""had she won the election, Clinton would have been significantly indebted to Google and Schmidt, whom she referred to as her 'longtime friend.'""WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange also brought up the relationship between Schmidt and the US establishment in his 2014 book, 'When Google Met WikiLeaks.' He describes a 2011 encounter with Schmidt in Norfolk, UK, where Assange was under house arrest at the time.""I had been too eager to see a politically unambitious Silicon Valley engineer, a relic of the good old days of computer science graduate culture on the West Coast. But that is not the sort of person who attends the Bilderberg conference four years running, who pays regular visits to the White House, or who delivers 'fireside chats' at the World Economic Forum in Davos,"" Assange wrote. ""Schmidt's emergence as Google's 'foreign minister' – making pomp and ceremony state visits across geopolitical fault lines – had not come out of nowhere; it had been presaged by years of assimilation within US establishment networks of reputation and influence.""Schmidt's political leanings became clear in the early days of Barack Obama's first presidential campaign. He publicly endorsed Obama, telling The Wall Street Journal in October 2008 that he was ""doing this personally,"" as Google was ""officially neutral"" in the election. He also served as an informal adviser to Obama's campaign.Schmidt also donated $5,000, the maximum allowed by law, to Obama's 2008 campaign, according to US media reports that cited a now-deleted official list of donors. Schmidt's close relationship with Obama didn't end when the Democratic candidate was elected. Schmidt chaired the board of public policy think tank New America Foundation, working closely with Obama as a member of his Transition Economic Advisory Board. Later, Schmidt claimed a seat on Obama's new Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.The two became so close that the Consumer Watchdog sent a letter to the White House demanding that Obama distance himself from Google, and stop inviting Schmidt to fancy galas in Washington, DC. The group pointed out that Schmidt, and then-Google Vice President Marissa Mayer, were invited to a state dinner despite the company being under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over allegations that it profited from selling online ads to illegal pharmacies.""Executives of companies under federal criminal investigation should not be invited while a major case is pending. Allowing such executives to hobnob at a gala White House event inevitably sends a message that the Administration supports them and undercuts the ability of federal investigators to proceed with their case in a fair and unbiased way,"" reads the letter, dated June 23, 2011. Schmidt also supported Obama's 2012 campaign, helping to recruit talent, deciding on technology, as well as mentoring campaign manager, Jim Messina. He was present in the Chicago, Illinois boiler room on election night. The Google executive was apparently so impressed by Obama's campaign staff that he invested in several start-ups founded by the analysts and engineers who worked on it, one of those being The Groundwork. Schmidt's announcement to 'de-rank' RT's articles comes despite Google's own investigation saying it found no manipulation of its platform or policy violations by RT. There may be more ground to question Schmidt's integrity than that of RT – but that's highly unlikely to happen in today's climate, because Google is not a Russian company."
"On Monday evening, US District Court Judge William Orrick, of California’s Northern District, slammed one of President Donald Trump’s first executive orders. Executive Order 13768, titled “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” was determined to be “unconstitutional on its face,” the judge wrote, according to documents obtained by USA Today.Trump’s order denied not only federal grants, but also federal funding for local jurisdictions with policies against cooperating or assisting federal immigration officers in identifying or detaining illegal immigrants. These so-called “sanctuary cities” or “sanctuary jurisdictions” have risen in number for several years, but they fall under a broad category.San Francisco County and Santa Clara County claimed they were at risk of losing $2 billion in federal funds under the January 25 executive order. They argued that the executive order was unconstitutional, because it violated the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government.Judge Orrick concurred that the US Constitution only delegates spending powers to Congress, but he went further in his judgment of Trump’s order.“It is so broad and coercive that even if the President had spending powers, the Executive Order would clearly exceed them and violate the Tenth Amendment's prohibition against commandeering local jurisdictions. It is so vague and standardless that it violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and is void for vagueness,” Orrick wrote.The judge had placed a temporary hold on the order in April. Monday’s decision made that injunction permanent and effective nationwide. The Trump administration has appealed to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.READ MORE: California judge rules against Trump’s ban on sanctuary cities"
"The results of the survey, carried out by German-based market research firm GfK and independent political consultant Professor Simon Anholt, were unveiled on Monday. It ranks the reputation of 50 countries through six categories – people, governance, exports, culture and heritage, tourism and investment and immigration – which it measures by polling 20,185 people across 20 countries. This year the survey was conducted July 7-25.Germany moved up from second to first place in 2017, ranking first in every category except tourism, in which it came tenth. France came in second place, up from fifth place in 2016, while despite the political uncertainty around Brexit, the UK managed to remain in third. GfK’s press release says that this suggests that fellow European states have now “come to terms with the UK’s vote last year to leave the EU, and their perception has resettled following that shock.” Fourth place was jointly occupied by Japan and Canada.The United States, however, fell dramatically from first place to sixth, mainly due to issues of governance. It was also the only country whose rating actually fell.“The USA’s fall in the ‘Governance’ category suggests that we are witnessing a ‘Trump effect,’ following President Trump’s focused political message of ‘America First’,” Anholt said in a statement. “However, Americans’ assessment of their own country is notably more positive this year than last. A similar fall in global perception of the US was seen following the reelection of George W. Bush, when the USA fell to seventh place. Previously, America has never stayed outside the top ranking for more than a year at a time: it will be interesting to see whether this holds true in the 2018 ranking.”Speaking to The Independent, Anholt added that while President Trump might believe his focus on the American economy is good business sense, how his country is perceived on the global stage is also of paramount importance.“It turns out that we don’t mainly admire other countries for being successful or rich or powerful: we mainly admire the countries that contribute the most to the world we live in,” he said. “This is bad news for the US if it persists, since a positive national reputation is itself one of the key drivers of trade, tourism, foreign investment and much else besides. Trump’s efforts to boost US trade by focusing on US needs could, paradoxically, have exactly the opposite effect, by reducing the ‘brand value’ of the country and consequently everything it sells and does.""The world’s low opinion of both President Trump and the United States has been confirmed by other polls. According to the results of a Pew survey published in June, a median of just 22 percent across 37 countries trust the US Commander-in-Chief to make the right decisions in foreign affairs."
"Agent Rogelio Martinez, 36, and his partner were on patrol in the Big Bend sector of southwestern Texas when the incident occurred and Martinez died. His partner, whom the authorities have not identified, remains hospitalized in serious condition.An official statement from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – the agency which oversees the Border Patrol – says that Agent Martinez died “as a result of injuries sustained while on patrol.”Art Del Cueto, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, told the El Paso Proud that “one agent was murdered,” adding that “we strongly believe rocks were what was used.”The FBI has taken over the investigation into the incident.

"“Today the United States is designating North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism,” Trump declared from the White House on Monday. “It should have happened a long time ago, should have happened years ago.”“In addition to threatening the world with nuclear devastation, North Korea has supported international acts of terrorism including assassinations on foreign soil,” Trump added.The US has accused Pyongyang of killing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's estranged half-brother in a Malaysian airport this year, declaring it an act of terrorism.“The North Korean regime must be lawful, must end its nuclear ballistic missile development and cease all support for international terrorism, which it is not doing,” remarked Trump, sitting next to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.US President @realDonaldTrump designates North Korea a state sponsor of terrorhttps://t.co/loyJNkODLiThe president also brought up the case of Otto Warmbier, an American student who was arrested and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment with hard labor while visiting North Korea as a tourist in January 2016. Warmbier was convicted of attempted theft. One month after his sentencing, he suffered a severe neurological injury and was in a comatose state for 17 months. Diplomatic efforts led to his release in June, but he died six days later. US officials blame North Korea for his death.“This designation will impose further sanctions and penalties on North Korea and related persons, and supports our massive pressure campaign to isolate the murderous regime you’ve all been reading about and in some cases, writing about,” Trump said.The Treasury Department will announce additional sanctions against Pyongyang on Tuesday. North Korea already faces a barrage of UN sanctions, including restrictions on fuel imports and guest workers. Washington has pushed for diplomatic isolation of Pyongyang, citing North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile tests as a threat to the entire world.The US has also asked China to cut off the pipeline that delivers oil to North Korea, Tillerson told reporters at a White House press briefing on Monday.“I don’t know that cutting off all is the magic wand or silver bullet that will bring them to the table,” he said. “They’ll make their people pay, but they have an enormous capacity to withstand a lot.”In September, the Trump administration sanctioned eight North Korean banks and 26 individuals said to act as their representatives in various countries, including China, Russia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates. A week prior, Trump signed an executive order targeting North Korea’s access to the international banking system.In addition to North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria are on Washington's list of countries considered to be state sponsors of terrorism.This is North Korea’s second turn on the list. It was first added in 1988, after North Korean agents were accused of blowing up a South Korean passenger jet, killing all 115 on board. President George W. Bush removed North Korea from the list in 2008, after Pyongyang agreed to disable a plutonium plant and allow limited inspections to verify that it upheld its promise."
"US Air Force Gen. John Hyten, head of the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) said Saturday he would disobey any presidential order to carry out an atomic strike which he determined illegal, adding he would instead suggest other legitimate options to Donald Trump.Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, Hyten said the US military is not exactly unprepared to hear the nuclear order.""We're not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?"" he said.Hyten oversees the US strategic nuclear triad, consisting of long-range bombers, land-based intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.RT: Why is the question of illegal strikes even being raised? Is it alarming? Can this be seen as a shift in nuclear weapons rhetoric?Ivan Eland: This is unprecedented, I think, for a general to come out and say that he would refuse an illegal order from the president.RT: Do General John Hyten's remarks indicate there's little real threat now of a nuclear strike?IE: I think Donald Trump has used some pretty harsh rhetoric against North Korea, for example, “fire and fury” and he threatened to use nuclear weapons against the country indirectly if they threatened the US again. So the foreign policy and defense establishment here in the United States is pushing back on that. There was a former head of this command at the Congressional hearings last week who said the same thing that the military would push back if there were an illegal order to launch nuclear weapons. And then shortly after that, the current head of the Strategic Command, which deals with nuclear weapons, said the same thing. I think we are seeing these generals and former generals pushing back and saying, “Yes, the military would push back on an illegal order. Of course, the military in our country is pledged to stick up for the Constitution - not any one leader or Congress, or even the president."" If they launch nuclear weapons with an illegal order, they could be put in jail for it.RT: The Senate is holding hearings on whether there should be checks on the president's power to order nuclear strikes, the first since 1976. Has Trump's war of words with North Korea spooked lawmakers?IE: I think there is always some threat when the president uses such rhetoric. But … the rhetoric from both North Korea and the US has been really inflammatory. The US probably should turn down its rhetoric; you can’t do much about North Korea. But it doesn’t help when the president uses language like this. And I think it has alarmed not only US allies, but of course US foreign policy and the defense establishment as well. Congress held hearings last week for the first time in 40 years about the president’s authority to use nuclear weapons, and that hasn’t happened for a long time.RT: Could the outcome of the Senate hearings temper Trump's rhetoric?IE: There have been bills introduced in Congress in addition to the hearings last week that would say an offensive nuclear strike, meaning a first strike, cannot be conducted without a declaration of war by Congress. The Constitution is set up that way anyways. I think the law if passed, would reiterate this situation. I think it would probably be a useful measure, just as a reminder to the president and to the military that no offensive nuclear strike can be conducted without approval of the peoples’ houses. That is what our republic was originally set up do in the Constitution in 1787 for conventional war and the same should be done for nuclear war these days. The US Constitution is not out of date at all; it just needs to be reinforced among the military and other officials including the president."
"The origin of this feud goes back to LiAngelo and two of his University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) teammates getting arrested on suspicion of shoplifting sunglasses while on a team trip to China.The players allegedly stole the glasses from a store in Hangzhou. The players were confined to the team hotel while the incident was being investigated. They returned to the US on Tuesday and were indefinitely suspended by UCLA’s basketball program.On Thursday, Trump said his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping helped expedite the player’s return home without charges being filed, adding that they faced up to 10 years in jail.He also tweeted that they should be thankful to the Chinese president, and to him, and advised them to “be careful.""To the three UCLA basketball players I say:  You're welcome, go out and give a big Thank You to President Xi Jinping of China who made.........your release possible and, HAVE A GREAT LIFE! Be careful, there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life!The players thanked President Trump for helping to secure their release when they made a public apology. However, LaVar Ball downplayed Trump’s role in the fiasco in an interview on ESPN.""Who?” Ball said when discussing Trump’s involvement in the matter. “What was he over there for? Don't tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out.”The president chose to fire back directly at LaVar on Sunday, saying: “I should have left them in jail!”Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!The Ball family has its own reality show, Ball in the Family, which airs on Facebook. As well as LiAngelo the family includes Los Angeles Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball and high school phenomenon LaMelo, who is already committed to UCLA.Despite his son’s prowess on the basketball court, the undeniable star of the reality show is LaVar. The patriarch has shot to fame for his larger-than-life personality and his outlandish claims about his son’s, and his own, ability. He famously said: “Back in my heyday, I would kill Michael Jordan one-on-one.”His loudmouth personality has raised his profile to such as extent that he is now regularly parodied on Saturday Night Live. A war of words with America’s outspoken president seems like the logical next step in the LaVar Ball phenomenon."
"Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), said he would not blindly follow whatever order comes from US President Donald Trump, noting that the law of armed conflict that prohibits the use of disproportionate force and inflicting unnecessary suffering would be a higher authority when it comes to decision-making.""I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do. And if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say, 'Mr. President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options, with a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works. It's not that complicated.""Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, Hyten said the US military is not exactly unprepared to hear the nuclear order.""We're not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?"" he said.In his capacity as STRATCOM commander, Hyten oversees the US strategic nuclear triad, consisting of long-range bombers, land-based intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.  READ MORE: N. Korea rules out negotiations with US, cites 'hostile policy' & joint exercises with SeoulIt comes amid a debate over whether certain checks and balances should be put on the president’s authority to use nukes. At the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Tuesday, the first one of this kind in over 40 years, some senators raised the alarm about Trump, who has threatened to unleash “fire and fury” against North Korea, pulling the nuclear trigger.“We are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with US national security interests,” Senator Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut) said.Adding fuel to the fire, Republican Senator Bob Corker, who last month accused Trump of running the country as a reality show on course to a third World War, noted that “once that order [to launch a nuclear strike] is given and verified, there is no way to revoke it.”Although the former STRATCOM commander Robert Kelly attempted to reassure the committee that the US military would not comply with an order that infringes international law, some US media responded to the hearing by stoking alarmism.The Los Angeles Times published a column by Doyle McManus, which had the question and answer in the headline: “Is there anything stopping Trump from launching a nuclear strike? Nope.”“Nobody can stop Trump from launching nukes — and it’s freaking senators out” Vice News’ Alexa Liautaud wrote.Since Trump came into office, the US has taken a much harder stance on North Korea with the US leader regularly trading verbal barbs with the with the pariah state’s leader, Kim Jong-un.While Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea in his notorious speech at the UN, calling Kim a “rocket man…on a suicide mission,” Pyongyang responded by threatening to reduce the US to “ashes and darkness,” and North Korean state media “sentenced” the US leader to death.Hyten's attempts to calm the waters, however, might not come entirely from a desire for world peace. His own well-being is at stake as well.""If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life,"" Hyten said."
"In response to reports suggesting that the US State Department is about to shut down the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) office in Washington, which acts as the nation's diplomatic mission in the US capital, the Palestinian president’s spokesman said the move could damage US relations throughout the Middle East.Having called the reported decision ""unprecedented in the history of US-Palestinian relations,"" Mahmoud Abbas' spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said it ""could have serious consequences on the peace process and US-Arab relations,"" Palestine News Agency WAFA reported Saturday.The official also called the reported Washington's decision ""a reward to Israel,"" having accused Tel Aviv of ""obstructing"" all efforts in reaching a peace deal and ""refusing to accept the principle of the two-state solution."" At the same time, the Trump administration has demonstrated a lack of effort in contributing to the peace process, he said.""The Palestinian side has not received any ideas, even though many months have passed and in spite of numerous meetings held with the US side, which disqualifies the US administration from playing the role of a mediator and removes itself from the job as sponsor of the political process,"" Rudeineh's statement said.Should Washington proceed with its reported plans to shut down the PLO mission, Palestine would cut off all communication with the Trump administration, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Saturday, AP reported. A warning letter had been sent to Washington, the official said. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Maliki also reacted to the news, saying that ""extortion or pressure"" would be unacceptable. READ MORE: John Kerry condemns Israel, hails ‘extraordinary’ restraint of PalestiniansOn Friday, unidentified US officials told AP that the Trump administration was planning to close the Palestinian office in Washington unless Abbas’s administration enters into serious peace talks with Israel.

"Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) introduced the Liberty Act bill which will reauthorize the controversial Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This gives US intelligence agencies permission to spy on and store internet metadata and communications of foreign people living outside the US, along with communications of US citizens which get “swept up” in the data collection. This data can then be searched at a later date without a warrant.The authorization for the George W Bush-era program is set to expire on December 31 if Congress doesn’t renew it. The Liberty Act would extend Section 702 for six years, with a number of small improvements.The bill will “enhance accountability, and increase protections for queries of Section 702 metadata, among other important reforms,” the senators said.FISA court finds NSA violated search restrictions, spied on Americans https://t.co/mGK60E9b68pic.twitter.com/LTjQCLp6xhSome of the spying programs revealed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden are included under Section 702, including PRISM, which sweeps up data from servers of tech giants like Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.Upstream collection is a form of bulk surveillance used by the NSA to search internet traffic and communications as they’re in transit via cables and routers. Americans who communicate with people overseas or use websites hosted on servers in other countries are exposed to the NSA’s bulk interception tool. The NSA stores this data and it can be searched at a later date.The Liberty Act would place stricter limits on the government’s ability to search “communications of Americans and persons inside the United States, to ensure this surveillance is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.”It would impel government agencies to get a probable cause warrant before “backdoor searching” NSA data collected under Section 702. However, a warrant is only needed to search for evidence of a known crime, meaning it’s still okay to search for foreign intelligence or to see whether a crime may have occurred.  Sweeping, warrant-free internet #surveillance must be reauthorized – US spy chiefs  https://t.co/Er60eh7piapic.twitter.com/1AjN9VUIDoThe Electronic Frontiers Foundation highlights how the bill fails to bring an end to the controversial backdoor searching. It also fails to address the use of secrecy to prevent oversight and transparency.According to the proposed act, if the NSA determines that particular communications being stored are of no foreign intelligence value, they must be removed within 90 days. However, the NSA isn’t obligated to review said data, and any collected data that it thinks could still have possible value can be kept indefinitely.Similar legislation has been introduced as Section 702’s expiration date approaches; The USA Rights Act would extend Section 702 for another four years but with reforms included to curb surveillance abilities, including a fix for the backdoor search loophole.""Not a political matter, but a safety matter” - AG #JeffSessionshttps://t.co/mnAt478kKsAnother bill being touted is the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act. Introduced by Richard Burr (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it aims to reauthorize Section 702 for eight years, without reform, but with additional violations of civil liberties.In fact, it aims to bring back “about” collection, whereby the NSA searches web traffic for any mention of intelligence targets. This means if someone mentions that target in an email, the email’s contents will be viewable, and then storable. The NSA ended this practice in April, to reduce chances of collecting US citizens’ communications."
"A new report by a Pentagon watchdog suggested US forces in Afghanistan did not intervene in cases of child-sex abuse because they were told it is a “culturally accepted practice” in the country. The report added that US soldiers who raised concerns were told that nothing could be done as it is an internal issue for Afghanistan.The US Marine Corps operational cultural-awareness guide for Afghanistan provides marines with specific guidance on interacting with the Afghan populace, and it includes the statement that marines “need to understand the culture, accept it without making judgments, and figure out how to work with it or around it to accomplish your mission.” RT discussed the controversy with former US diplomat Jim Jatras.“These reports have been in the media here and there for years. Everybody knew this was going on, who cared to know. But now we have something official pointing out that this was actually the policy of the US government to look the other way at what amounts to child abuse,” Jim Jatras told RT.“It really does make you ask the question: is that why Americans are fighting and risking their lives in Afghanistan to make the world safe for pedophilia? I understand that when you are in the country where this is a common practice, “multiculturalism in action”, that you would run into a world of trouble if you actually try to stamp it out. But if you don’t and you are actually condoning it and helping to establish it in this society – what does that tell us? What kind of moral bankruptcy is behind this presence in Afghanistan?” he continued.“There is a complete double standard. We can’t say anything about not only child abuse in Afghanistan but stoning women and honor killings in Afghanistan,” he said.  Jatras recalled that in Afghanistan “during the Soviet period and the pre-Soviet period, there was a lot of liberation of women during that time, which has been put a stop to now that our friends Mujahedeen have come to power – but we have to respect their sovereignty!”“On the other hand, in countries like, say, Serbia, we pressure them to have gay-rights parades and all sorts of things that, as a sovereign matter, they don’t want to have, but we are more than happy to push a very perverse human-rights agenda on them. We are ‘respectful of sovereignty’ when we feel like it and we run over it rough shod when we don’t feel like it,” he added.He says he doesn’t think the US approach has changed at all over time: “It was foolish from the beginning – when Bush talked about Afghanistan, also let’s remember his invasion of Iraq – these people really did seem to believe the notion that all societies and all social values are basically the same, and all you have to do is ‘remove the bad dictator,’ in case of Iraq, and peace and niceness will simply break out spontaneously.”Jatras pointed out that “in a place like Iraq, when you remove the secular dictator and you end up with various kinds of Sharia and religious, Islamic agendas, you get less human rights, not more human rights. Look at the kind of jihadist fanatics we’ve been supporting in Syria.”“There seems to be almost a mental block that these people have between their illusions about political liberation, on the one hand, and their unwillingness to face the reality of just how brutal and contrary to any decent notion of human rights and civilization you do find in some countries,” he noted."
"READ MORE: Russia vetoes 'unbalanced' US resolution on Syrian chemical weapons, but its draft fails“With the unity of this council, or alone, unrestrained by Russia’s obstructionism, we will continue to fight for justice and accountability in Syria,” Haley said, blasting Russia’s vetoing of the draft resolution on the extension of the Syrian chemical weapons probe on Friday.The draft, proposed by Japan, envisioned the “technical extension” of the probe for another 30 days. Explaining Russia’s decision to block the resolution, Russian UN envoy Vasily Nebenzya said that there is no sense in prolonging the mission if some glaring flaws in its work are not amended.""There can be no other way after the JIM’s [the UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism] leadership disgraced itself with its fictitious investigation into the sarin use incident in Khan Shaykhun and signed off on baseless accusations against Syria,” he said.Haley went on to accuse Russia of showing no flexibility in negotiating the conditions of the probe, claiming that Moscow had only “dictated and demanded” while the US had “incorporated elements of the Russian draft” into its own in the hopes of reaching a consensus.Russia vetoed the US draft on Thursday, with Nebenzya calling it “unbalanced” and solely designed to discredit Russia and its role in the Syrian settlement. Haley subsequently accused the Russian mission of ignoring the US delegation's attempts to contact it before the vote.READ MORE: ‘Full of systemic deficiencies’: Russia slams OPCW report on Idlib chemical attack at UNSCHaley’s remarks on the impossibility of reaching the Russian mission provoked an angry reaction from Moscow, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov calling it “fake diplomacy.” Lavrov said that ""it seems we are witnessing a new phenomenon in international relations, as now, apart from fake news, there is also fake diplomacy.""The rival draft was co-sponsored by Russia and China, and “aimed at the extension and qualitative improvement” of the fact-finding mission, according to Nebenzya. However, it also failed, gaining the support of only four Security Council members.While both Russia and the US used their veto powers on the respective resolutions, Haley accused Moscow of obstructing the work of the UNSC and its efforts to find “the truth.”Russia has repeatedly criticized the UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM)’s report on the chemical incident in Khan Shaykhun as being filled with “omissions, inconsistences and contradictions.” It also says it does not follow standard procedures for an impartial inquiry as it relies on questionable testimonies provided by rebels and NGOs, some of which are suspected of links to terrorists. In particular, it pointed to experts’ refusal to visit the site of the attack despite security guarantees.In 2011, the US intervened in the region to curb the violence in the ongoing civil war in Libya. Under the pretext of a UN mandate to establish a no-fly zone in the country and save civilian lives, the US-led NATO coalition waged a full-fledged campaign that eventually resulted in the slaughter of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and multiple civilian deaths, the number of which varies from 72, according to Human Rights Watch, to more than 1,000 in unconfirmed reports. The country is still in tatters and the war involving tribes and militants is ongoing. Despite the UN not giving the greenlight for a full-fledged campaign in Syria, US Defense Secretary James Mattis claimed that the organization sanctioned action there, justifying it with the struggle against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists. Damascus has repeatedly blasted the US for operating on Syrian territory without its consent and in violation of international law, and views the US presence as an invasion.The US is not likely to take any military action in Syria without UNSC approval, Robert Naiman, policy director at Just Foreign Policy and president of the Truth Out organization, told RT, commenting on US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley’s statement.“Certainly, the US, like any other country, can take non-military action outside the scope of the Security Council: [it can call a] press conference, it can issue reports, they can do all kinds of things. The US is not, of course, allowed to take military action in Syria without the endorsement of the Security Council, and arguably, it is already in violation of international law for the military actions that it is taking because they have not been explicitly endorsed by the Security Council,” Naiman said."
"The Friday evening tweet follows a backlash after the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFS) announced on Thursday it would begin issuing permits for the import of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia hunted from January 21, 2016 to December 31, 2018.Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke followed up with a statement later in the night.Zinke tweeted that he and Trump “both believe that conservation & healthy herds are critical,” and that the permitting process was being put on hold..@realDonaldTrump & I have talked & both believe that conservation & healthy herds are critical...the issuing of permits is put on hold... pic.twitter.com/tdDf9GaqwREarlier Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that the decision was made under former President Barack Obama after a review from the US Fish and Wildlife Service determined that Zimbabwe and Zambia met standards to allow hunting by Americans.Huckabee Sanders said the review established Zambia and Zimbabwe both met “strict international conservation standards” allowing Americans to resume hunting in those countries.“All of this was based on a study that was conducted -- that started back to the previous administration and done by career officials,” Huckabee Sanders said at Friday’s White House press briefing.The USFS said that they reviewed information from non-governmental organizations, safari outfitters and professional hunter associations in the countries and found that the population management had improved enough to address their concerns.The service said that elephant trophy hunting in Zimbabwe “will enhance the survival of the species in the wild.”“The Service will allow imports from countries that have well-managed hunting programs that are contributing to conservation of elephants in the wild. We hope that these approvals will encourage other countries to strengthen their elephant conservation efforts,” the service said in the announcement.“American hunters make up the largest proportion of people who hunt overseas, placing our nation in a key role to support science-based, well-managed hunting programs abroad,” the service said in the announcement.The move drew criticism from several media agencies, which blamed the Trump administration for the decision.“Trophies from elephant hunts in Zimbabwe were banned in the US Trump just reversed that,” one headline from the Washington Post reads.“Lions next in line of fire as US rolls back curbs on African hunting trophies,” another headline from the Guardian read.The decision also drew a flood of criticism on social media, with users pointing the finger at the Trump administration.Compassion, social intelligence, decisiveness, patience, wisdom. These are all qualities found in elephants and not found in the people allowing them to be killed for trophies. #NotUsDear people with no soul , stop shooting Elephants https://t.co/T0fThLjOWHI swear to god if Trump keeps bowing to the Safari Club I am going to lose it https://t.co/9HHhqa7K5JTrump's sons enjoy killing wild animals in Africa. Now Trump is reversing Obama’s ban to save elephants, which will allow them to be shot for trophies and imported back into the United States. Horrifying.Congressman Ed Royce (R-California), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he has “zero confidence” that Zimbabwe is “properly managing and regulating conservation programs” of that the elephant populations in the area“warrant overconcentration measures.”“The administration should withdraw this decision until Zimbabwe stabilizes. Elephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate,” Royce said in a statement issued Friday.The USFS said they are making country-level decisions on whether importing hunted elephants would “enhance the survival of the species in the wild” and will continue to review each application on a case-by-case basis.The federal agency also reviewed Namibia and South Africa, but decided to keep the suspension in place for both countries. A review of Tanzania is still pending because the service was “not able to make the findings necessary to allow the import of sport-hunted trophies.”“Unless information is received that shows a significantly improved situation for elephants in Tanzania such that the required findings could be made, permit applications for the import of elephant sport-hunted trophies will be denied,” the service said.African elephants are protected under the endangered species list and their populations in Africa have dropped by 30 percent in seven years, according to the African Wildlife Foundation."

"The report from Chris Vickery and Dan O’Sullivan of the security firm UpGuard reveals that the Defense Department’s Central Command (CENTCOM) and US Pacific Command (PACOM) were collecting billions of social media posts and storing them on Amazon’s cloud platform.UpGuard say at least 1.8 billion posts, which were apparently collected as part of intelligence gathering operations, were contained in the exposed data “buckets.” This included content from Facebook, Twitter and news sites. It came from countries around the world, including America, and it was collected over an eight-year period.The Cyber Risk team's latest disclosure: billions of records exposed from a US military program to harvest social media posts.

The posts are written in many different languages but UpGuard notes there appears to be an emphasis on Arabic, Farsi, and dialects spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan.The researchers said the the revelation poses two questions: why did the Pentagon collect the enormous archive of data, and why did it store it on such a vulnerable platform?UpGuard notes that “the Posse Comitatus Act restricts the military from 'being used as a tool for law enforcement, except in situations of explicit national emergency based on express authorization from Congress,' but as seen in recent years, this separation has been eroded.”The Defense Department responded to the report in a statement to CNN.""We determined that the data was accessed via unauthorized means by employing methods to circumvent security protocols,” said Major Josh Jacques, a spokesperson for CENTCOM. ""Once alerted to the unauthorized access, CENTCOM implemented additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access.”The buckets were discovered by Vickery in early September. He made the revelation public on Friday.The cybersecurity expert has previously exposed several similar data protection gaffes such as when over 9,000 sensitive files containing the personal data of former military, intelligence and government workers were left in public view for months and when up to 14 million Verizon customers’ details were left on an unsecured server."

""I think all the members also realize that this is very crucial, that we need a tax bill out of here, and I think that's why there's not a lot of angst over whether we have the votes tomorrow. I think we'll be right on target.""The House bill would consolidate individual and family tax brackets from seven to four and reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. It would also end or scale back some popular deductions.The Senate proposal ties tax cuts to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) individual mandate, returning to attempts to repeal ""Obamacare"" that foundered this summer amid monolithic opposition from Democrats joined by Republicans like Senator John McCain (R-Arizona).“A simple, fair and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it’s within our reach. Now is the time to deliver,” the White House said in a statement following the vote."
"McCabe wrote in an email to FBI press officials that the Clinton email probe was being controlled by a small number of high-ranking officials at the Bureau’s headquarters in Washington DC.“As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team,” McCabe wrote in the October 23, 2016 email. “WFO [Washington field office] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a ‘special’ and I was not given any details about it.”McCabe said he had no input into the Clinton email investigation when it began in the summer of 2015. He was assistant director of the FBI Washington office at the time.  #DonnaBrazile blasts ‘cancer’ of Clinton campaign’s stranglehold on DNC https://t.co/MuAn9asFBVpic.twitter.com/XNPSck5cydThe new emails were released on the FBI’s public records site, The Vault, on Wednesday and relate to a controversy surrounding McCabe’s wife Jill, who received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Clinton fundraiser and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe during her 2015 Senate run.  McCabe sent a timeline of his involvement in the Clinton email probe to FBI press officials who were fielding questions from a Wall St Journal reporter looking into whether McCabe had a conflict of interest with the Clinton case while his wife was receiving donations from McAuliffe.Jill McCabe announced she was running for the Senate in March 2015, the same month that it emerged Clinton had been using a private email server. Andrew McCabe took over the Clinton probe in February 2016, when he became deputy director.On Wednesday, FBI officials declined to answer questions about what McCabe meant when he described the probe as a “special,” the Hill reports.#Russia 'tried to shape the way we think, we vote, we act... They're coming after #America!' - #ComeyLIVE: https://t.co/QWoWrjsXqupic.twitter.com/4qQbLmX9OPThe documents also include an October 27 letter from Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, asking McCabe to produce documents related to his wife’s campaign and the Clinton investigation, following related media reports.The emails also include one from McCabe, forwarding a True Pundit article to FBI Director James Comey, entitled, ‘FBI Director Lobbied Against Criminal Charges For Hillary After Clinton Insider Paid His Wife $700,000.’McCabe writes, “FYI. Heavyweight source.”  However, Comey responded: “This still reads to be like someone not involved in the investigation at all, maybe somebody who heard rumors (inaccurate) about why John left” –  a reference to John Giacalone, the former supervisor of the FBI’s National Security Branch whom the True Pundit article describes as the “brains and genesis” behind the Clinton investigation, and alleges he “abruptly resigned” from the probe.“This strikes me as lower level folks who admire John (which is fine, because I do) telling yarns,” Comey added.Comey’s Clinton statement edited - 'grossly negligent' replaced with less incriminating 'extremely careless' https://t.co/MbwQSsWtM7The latest revelation about the “special” status could see Comey further criticized for his handling of the Clinton email investigation. Comey found in July 2016 that while Clinton had been “extremely careless,” in her handling of classified information, she shouldn’t be criminally charged.However, earlier this month it emerged that an earlier version of Comey’s statement written in May described Clinton’s actions as being “grossly negligent,” which could have seen her face felony charges. However, it was edited by officials before its release, the Hill reports. McCabe was among the three officials involved in shaping and editing the statement.Comey has previously insisted that the investigation was carried out in an “entirely apolitical and professional way.”"
"On Wednesday, Moore’s campaign attorney Phillip Jauregui held a press conference outside the Alabama Republican Party headquarters to challenge one of the sexual assault allegations the candidate is facing.Moore, through his attorney, said there was “no way in the world” he wrote the inscription on a yearbook cited as evidence on Monday by accuser Beverly Young Nelson. Jauregui called on Allred to release the yearbook so a handwriting expert could “draw their own conclusions.”“Release the yearbook so we can determine is it genuine or is it a fraud,” Jauregui said.Nelson accused Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16, when he was in his 30s. Nelson said that in the late 1970’s, Moore drove her to a deserted area, where he groped her breasts, tried to pull off her shirt and pushed her head toward his crotch.Ms. Nelson's printed statement includes a picture of Moore's note in her yearbook...""Love, Roy Moore D.A."" pic.twitter.com/cXfLThHkb0“To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, 'Merry Christmas,” the message read. “Love, Roy Moore DA.”Jauregui pointed to the initials “DA” after the signature, clarifying that Moore was not the district attorney at the time, but only the assistant district attorney. How those letters got there, according to Moore’s lawyer, may be connected to another hole in the accuser’s story.During the news conference on Monday, Nelson said that she never had any contact with Moore after the incident. However, Jauregui said that was a lie, citing the fact that Moore was the judge who presided over her divorce case in 1999. Jauregui suggested that the “DA” was how Moore’s assistant, Deborah Adams, wrote her initials on an order in the case.Just after the press conference on Wednesday, another woman accused Moore of sexual assault, saying he grabbed her buttocks.In a tweet Wednesday, Moore accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of “attempting to subvert the will of Alabamians” by “helping to elect a far-left Democrat.”Mitch McConnell is attempting to subvert the will of Alabamians yet again, this time helping to elect a far-left Democrat! #alsenDavid Alcon, a Democrat running for the US House of Representatives in New Mexico’s second district, was arrested by Albuquerque police on Friday after a woman accused him of stalking her, according to the New Mexican.A Santa Fe judge signed a warrant for Alcon’s arrest nearly two weeks ago after a woman told police that Alcon sent her a series of threatening text messages while she was at a Halloween party. Alcon allegedly sent the woman a picture of his genitals, and a series of text messages telling her he loved her and wanted to have children with her.The woman said that she texted Alcon back multiple times, telling him “that she did not want anything to do with Alcon, and she repeatedly told him to leave her alone,” according to the criminal complaint obtained by The New Mexican.The woman told police that she met Alcon 10 years ago at a political party and he had been texting her ever since, according to The New Mexican.She later called the police and told them Alcon was at her apartment, watching her, according to KRQE.Before Alcon’s sentencing, District Judge Michael Vigil said that his charges were “unbelievable.”“That is creepy. That is scary for a person. You would not go away. Violence takes a lot of different forms. [What you did] was a form of violence to the victim,” Vigil said, according to the Daily Caller.Alcon was previously arrested for stalking in 2007 after he broke into his girlfriend’s house and continued to show up and leave her messages without her consent, according to The New Mexican.After Alcon was arrested, Meredith Kelly, spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), called his alleged behavior “despicable and serious.”“He is not fit to run for office in New Mexico or anywhere else,” Kelly said in a statement to The New Mexican. “The DCCC has not had any interaction with him, and in light of these allegations, neither Chairman Lujan nor the DCCC will support his candidacy.”Alcon has still not filed the paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for the congressional seat currently held by Republican Rep. Steve Pearce, who is running for governor.Alcon’s arrest has not been covered on any of the mainstream media networks, who have spent a combined 79 minutes talking about the allegations against Moore between November 9 and November 13, according to the Daily Caller."
"US Defense Secretary James Mattis said America will not withdraw from Syria, even after the total defeat of ISIS. The announcement came ahead of UN-backed peace talks on the future of the war-torn country.“You know, the UN said that … basically, we can go after ISIS. And we're there to take them out. But that doesn't mean we just walk away and let ISIS 2.0 pop back around,” the US defense secretary said on Monday.While Syria continues to insist Washington's intervention is illegal, Mattis claims it is justified. The UN Charter recognizes only two justifications for the use of military force in a foreign country. The first is having the permission of the Security Council, and the second is self-defense.RT:  Mattis says the US is there for self-defense. Does that hold water?Kamal Alam: Not at all… In terms of American intervention in Syria, it needs legitimate backing by the Syrian government – it doesn’t have. So as far as international law goes, it is a clear violation. I think it is also a reflection of US frustration. They are more or less locked out of the Syrian war. They don’t have much influence over the end game. By staying in, they want to be some kind of spoiler or at least some kind of minor player toward the war in Syria.UN let US intervene in Syria, although it never did - US Defense Secretary https://t.co/jsiNWTXBusRT:  If it is against international law, will there be any ramifications, do you think?KA: … It depends [on the] Turkish, Iranian and Russian responses to this, because the de-escalation zones in Syria [have been] more or less working over the last few months, and the US is not part of that – same with the Astana process. So they want to be relevant, and they think by being there they will be relevant. Syria can complain to the UN it's within their right. They will have a legal charter as well. So this is an international game going on. The US and some other international bodies accuse Syrians of doing certain things in the war, while Syria, as a sovereign country and the Syrian government as a legitimate government is recognized by the UN – they are within their right to complain and indeed take the US to court over this.RT:  What does America stand to gain from staying in Syria?KA: They don’t have really many cards left in Syria. Almost everything the US has tried to do has backfired. Of course six years ago, when the war started, backing groups that eventually became terrorists. We’ve seen recently as well – the US has been part of the deal that allowed ISIS to leave Raqqa. And it happened in Deir ez-Zor as well. They need to keep themselves relevant. They no longer have any legitimate cards to play in Syria. So by staying there and keeping forces – that is the only way they can be part of the endgame of the war.#Damascus condemned US-led coalition for adding ‘new bloody massacres’ to their ‘war crimes record’ https://t.co/YC47bK8XzgAbdo Haddad, a Syrian writer, and political analyst says mentioning “ISIS 2.0”, Secretary Mattis was actually “threatening the international community.”Commenting on what motives the US has for being in Syria, Haddad said it’s been following the same scenario “starting from Libya, going through Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.”“There is modus operandi they are using, they are repeating every time, and they should be questioned for it,” he told RT.“Mr. Mattis…is threatening indirectly…As his boss, Mr. Trump accused and confirmed that Obama and the Clintons have created ISIS – he is promising us to create ISIS 2.0. This is a threat to the international community,” he said.In his view, the Americans’ presence in Syria “is an occupation” and “colonization.”“They [the Americans] have no UN Security Council approval, nor UN charter approval, nor an agreement with the Syrian government. As per his statement, Mr. Mattis has many times bluffed his way into politics in our countries. It is an offense to common sense, not only to international laws. It is an offense to common sense,” he said.“The American presence in Syria is  an occupation, or at least colonization. It is a blackmail to get a political return out of it. You cannot destroy a city like Raqqa and then say ‘I am here to establish order, democracy,’ or whatever ‘good things’ they talk about,” Haddad added."
"Two months ago, the US Department of Homeland Security ordered agencies under its umbrella to identify Kaspersky Lab software on their computers and remove it from their networks on the grounds of the alleged espionage threat. The Moscow-based company was accused of leaking classified information to the Russian secret services.However, Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Jeanette Manfra told Congress on Tuesday that there is no “conclusive evidence” to support claims the antivirus developer has been involved in cyber-spying. Kaspersky Lab denies the allegations, stressing that it has never assisted any government with cyber-espionage efforts.“Basically we’re seeing the situations throughout the West today, where media reports generate hysteria, and cases whether they are of alleged sexual harassment, or alleged spying or whatever, are tried in the media. Governments are forced to respond before there has been a full investigation, or whether there are any merits or not to the allegations. We’re seeing a move toward governments trying to respond rapidly to public expressions of outrage about something, including the use of the Kaspersky antivirus software. They are making these judgments and take these actions based on more or less hysteria, rather than on detailed evidence,” says Gregory Copley, editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs, and president of the International Strategic Studies Association.However, even though there’s no evidence any networks had been breached because they use Kaspersky software, it’s unlikely the US government will retract its accusations against the company, Copley told RT.RT's @calebmaupin ​ reports as @wikileaks​ reveals @CIA wrote the code to impersonate Russian anti-virus lab.MORE: https://t.co/7QOnkrFVpTpic.twitter.com/xflpnyqbat“We saw this in many instances in recent history – whether that was the Western governments particularly going into the former Yugoslavia... Once they made that commitment, there was no retraction, simply because retraction implies a mistake has been made and mistakes like this cost lives. So no government is going to admit to that kind of embarrassment,” he said.“So no, I don’t expect the US government to retract its accusations against Kaspersky Lab. And that has done immense damage to the company in the global marketplace,” he added.Last week, WikiLeaks released the so-called Vault-8 files, indicating the CIA was impersonating Kaspersky Lab as a cover for its malware operations.Commenting on why would they choose Kaspersky and whether the WikiLeaks revelation undermines the accusations against the firm, Copley noted:“There is no question the allegations against the Kaspersky company were prompted by an anti-Russian hysteria in the US media and in the left-wing circles of the US political machinery. There is almost a rabid pathological view within media and the leftist circles in the US that Russia must be to blame for something. So they will keep making these allegations. It plays well to their base audience, which is basically the urban electorates. So they will keep making this because it does distract from other issues, which they should perhaps be paying more attention to in the US political scene.”Tim Anderson, Senior Lecturer in Political Economy at the University of Sydney agrees that this is all just a part of “anti-Russian hysteria” in the US.“Now we’ve got the spying accusation through the antivirus industry. Let’s remember Kaspersky was up in the top handful of antivirus companies, so it is very well established in the world – has about 400 million players. Let’s also remember that the US is increasingly having integrated relationships between its State Department and its security apparatus with US IT companies. Google, for example, now has close relationships with the State Department. Facebook has also been working with the State Department against what it calls ‘fake news.’ So there is a new climate where the US state itself as being engaged with IT companies,” Anderson said.In his view, the US government chose Kaspersky Lab as a scapegoat because it’s “in a sensitive sector” of the economy. But there are several other strategic sectors including energy where the US “is acting rather aggressively,” Anderson said.“The US is generally moving into a more protective role, which has to do with its sense of losing it hegemonic capacity and also its economic decline. I think we should see the anti-Russian hysteria linked up to what is a more broad economic war that is coming from the US. A series of unilateral measures that amount to a type of economic war,” he told RT."
"A wordy piece authored by Julia Ioffe and published by The Atlantic on Monday included a “largely one-sided” Twitter conversation between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. Quoting the direct messages, the story said WikiLeaks, “a radical transparency organization,” was actively soliciting Trump Jr’s cooperation, including by asking for his father’s tax returns.The story then repeats well-worn allegations of Russia’s involvement in the Trump presidential campaign and meddling in the 2016 US election, before rolling out the most striking passage on what WikiLeaks said was “the real kicker.” “If we publish [Trump’s tax returns] it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” WikiLeaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.”The full stop at the end of this quote might uncover The Atlantic’s initial intent to persuade the readership WikiLeaks did unevenly admit that its carries a pro-Trump, pro-Russia bias.The very same WikiLeaks message published earlier this week by Trump Jr himself reads: “That means the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing about Clinton will have a much higher impact, because it won't be perceived as coming from a 'pro-Trump' 'pro-Russian' source, which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with.”Here is the entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak.  How ironic!  1/3 pic.twitter.com/SiwTqWtykAThe Atlantic did not bother to add an ellipsis or a comma at the end of the quote to indicate it did not end there – which could be taken as saying a lot about the outlet’s professional ethos. Blatant omission of the end of the quote led to a misrepresentation of what the whistleblowing website was actually implying while pitching requests to the Trump camp.Responding on Monday, WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange said the news was “incredible.”“The Atlantic edited ‘Trump Jr’ DM story to reverse its meaning even removing ‘that the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with’ right after ‘pro-Russia’. Full text changes everything.”Incredible. The Atlantic edited ""Trump Jr"" DM story to reverse its meaning even removing ""that the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with"" right after ""pro-Russia"". Full text changes everything. https://t.co/8pNUF1xW23Ioffe seemingly tried to downplay the significance of the released DMs, retweeting Trump Jr’s messages with the comment: ""There are a couple missing pages in this release."" While she then soon deleted the post, mentions remained in other people’s tweets, such as “Julia Ioffe said you're missing a few pages here. So it seems you lied again. As usual,” tweeted @goostuffmaynard. Ioffe followed the post with: ""My bad, didn't realize there were three tweets. Carry on!"" This, however, has led some outlets to assert that The Atlantic piece’s author actually had the full text of the messages between WikiLeaks and the younger Trump and chose to omit part of the quote on purpose.“She read it, she analyzed it enough to figure out what was missing, but she said nothing about the fact that there were a lot more words in the sentence that she selectively edited out to convey the exact opposite of its meaning,” wrote Medium.com journalist Caitlin Johnstone. Interestingly, The Atlantic story also failed to mention that Assange’s internet connection was cut at the time some of the younger Trump’s messages were sent.Major journalism fails by the Atlantic author @juliaioffe in the Atlantic hit piece:She didn't disclose either of these key facts:1. Assange's internet had been cut off prior to the October 21 tweets2. Assange had publicly discussed having asked Trump JR to submit docs to WL pic.twitter.com/9ymtMPsP9QTrump Jr didn’t reply to WikiLeaks’ “real kicker” offer on tax returns, and its other proposals, such as the idea that Republican presidential hopeful Trump should challenge the results of the 2016 vote if he lost and that if elected Trump should suggest Australia appoint Assange as its ambassador to the US.Ioffe is no stranger to controversy herself and has strong feelings against the Trumps in particular. In December 2016, she was fired from Politico after tweeting, “Either Trump is f****** his daughter or he’s shirking nepotism laws. Which is worse?” She later apologized for the tweet, saying it was “a tasteless, offensive tweet that I regret and have deleted.”"
"In one of his latest tweets on Tuesday, Donald Trump offered what he thought was emotional comment on the latest shooting spree at Northern California’s Rancho Tehama, which left four people dead and many more injured. Somehow, it referred to another location instead.“May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived,” the tweet said.Trump’s Tuesday tweet was suspiciously similar to what he wrote on November 5, when a 26-year-old gunman opened fire at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people and injuring 20.“May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene,” Trump said at the time while on his Asian tour, claiming that he was “monitoring the situation from Japan.”May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.Trump has since deleted the tweet with no explanation, but not before it was shared and saved thousands of times. Twitter users reacted swiftly with both sarcasm and frustration. Some mocked the president’s error, while others speculated on the scale of rising gun violence in America’s cities.READ MORE: Trump tweet mystery: President’s #Covfefe message triggers troll tsunami“Wrong mass shooting, dude,” wrote a user named Lee Pacchia.Wrong mass shooting, dude... https://t.co/mCcJPiDYqX“Do you just have these tweets drafted to publish and forgot to change it from the mass shooting that happened last week?” one user tweeted.Do you just have these tweets drafted to publish and forgot to change it from the mass shooting that happened last week? https://t.co/3i1lIODRWyOthers wondered if the shootings are “happening too often in this country that you are just copy and pasting tweets to save time.”That was 9 days ago.

"Al Otro Lado, a Los Angeles-based immigrant rights group, filed a motion for class certification in their lawsuit against the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) on Monday, arguing that that the six plaintiffs in the case should be allowed to represent all asylum seekers subjected to the process.The lawsuit includes dozens of declarations and hundreds of experiences from individuals who claim that immigration officers “systematically” denied them access to the US asylum process.The plaintiffs claim CBP agents used “various unlawful tactics” to turn them away from Ports of Entry (POE) along the US-Mexico border, including misinformation, threats, intimidation, verbal abuse, physical force and coercion.According to the lawsuit, individuals from the countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras were told the US no longer accepts asylum seekers, that asylum seekers need permission from the Mexican government to seek asylum in the US, or that they must seek asylum at another POE.The lawsuit says that asylum seekers were threatened that they could lose custody of their children if they attempted to enter the US.In some cases, the lawsuit claims that immigration officers began citing President Donald Trump’s policies as the reason for turning asylum seekers away.Erika Pinheiro, Policy and Technology Director for Al Otro Lado, said that “unlawful and oppressive conduct against asylum seekers at our southern border” has “sharply escalated” since Trump took office.“The court must order wholesale relief for those who have suffered the abuses of CBP and for all future asylum seekers pursuing their right to safety,” Pinheiro said in a statement.Brantley Drake, an Equal Justice Works fellow with the Refugee Protection team at Human Rights First, conducted interviews with staff at a shelter in Mexico who also told him that there has been an increase in the number of asylum seekers being turned away and an “increased hostility toward asylum seekers by CBP agents” under the Trump administration.One officer was cited in the lawsuit, laughing at asylum seekers and telling them that Trump signed a new law that “there was no asylum for anyone.”‘Here to Stay’: DREAMers take over #Senate building, demand #immigration reform https://t.co/iycfOcvvNmpic.twitter.com/WSAlGCVeXxThe motions claims that these actions constitute “a clear violation of the Refugee Act” and asks the court to recognize the plaintiffs in the case as representatives for all non citizens who have presented themselves at a POE since June 2016, seeking asylum.Under US law, non-citizens who come to the US have the right to apply for asylum if their “life or freedom” would be threatened by returning to the country their country of origin. Specifically, asylum seekers must express their fear of returning to CBP agents in order to continue with the asylum process.The UN Refugee Agency reported a fivefold increase in asylum seekers arriving in the US from  the Northern Triangle region of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras between 2008 and 2015. The report said that the increase represented “a staggering indicator of the surging violence shaking the region.”However, the UN reported that in 2015, under former President Barack Obama, asylum seekers were also turned away multiple times, detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for long periods of time and deported multiple times."
"The UN cannot sanction a foreign invasion of Syria or any other country because it is absolutely impossible under international law, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said, commenting on the issue. “The UN cannot do such things,” he told the Russian media.He went on to say that “Syria is a sovereign independent state,” adding that “only the Syrian government can invite armed forces of the third countries onto its territory” while “the UN has no such right,” as reported by Rossiyskaya Gazeta daily. The diplomat also said that “the fight against terrorism does not give any states or coalitions a free hand to establish their presence on Syrian territory.”International law indeed envisages no way for the UN or any other international body to sanction an invasion of one state’s armed forces on the territory of another state. In fact, such actions are regarded as aggression under international law and are strictly prohibited.UN General Assembly Resolution 3314 on the definition of aggression explicitly states that an “invasion or attack by the armed forces of a State of the territory of another State” as well as “any military occupation, however temporary” or “bombardment by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State” is what particularly constitutes aggression.However, all these facts did not prevent Mattis from claiming that it was the UN that sanctified the presence of the US troops on the Syrian territory without the consent of the Syrian government. “You know, the UN said that … basically we can go after ISIS. And we're there to take them out,” the US defense secretary said, referring to the US actions in Syria as he answered a journalist’s question on Monday.Apparently, he implied that a call by UN on the international community and the US in particular to take action was more than enough to justify the US military’s presence in Syria. Actually, the UN did issue such a call – in Resolution 2249 adopted by the Un Security Council in November 2015.Resolution 2249 called on UN member states “that have the capacity to do so to take all necessary measures” and “to redouble and coordinate their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed specifically by ISIL [Islamic State (IS, former ISIS/ISIL)]” as well as other terrorist groups.However, it urged the states to do so “in compliance with international law” – something that the US officials often neglect when they assess the actions of the US military abroad.The statements of the US defense secretary also provoked an angry reaction in Damascus. The Syrian government once again stated that the US troops are operating on Syrian territory without its consent and in violation of international law.“The presence of the US forces or any foreign military presence in Syria without the consent of the Syrian government constitutes an act of aggression and an attack on the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic as well as a gross violation of the Charter and principles of the United Nations,” Syria’s Foreign Ministry said, as cited by the SANA news agency.It further said that the US presence “only leads to prolonging the crisis and further complicating it,” adding that the real goal of the US in Syria apparently lies in obstructing the peace process. The ministry then once again called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of US forces from Syrian territory.The statements made by Mattis are “absolutely baseless” and “irresponsible,” Vyacheslav Matuzov, a political scientist and the head of the Russian-Arab Friendship and Business Cooperation Society, told RT, commenting on the issue. He went on to say that any foreign military presence on the territory of any state can be authorized solely by the legitimate government of that state.“There is a clear position of the Syrian authorities, according to which the US troops are stationed on the Syrian territory illegally,” he said, adding that there can be “no argument” about the legal status of US forces in Syria."
"In a non-binding move, the lawmakers publicly acknowledged that the US military support for Saudi Arabia and its allies in Yemen, which involves sharing information and refueling warplanes, goes beyond what Congress has approved. It further explains that US forces are authorized to combat only Al-Qaeda or its affiliates as well as other terrorist groups in Yemen – but not the Houthi rebels that are targeted by the Saudis.Congress “has not enacted specific legislation authorizing the use of military force against parties participating in the Yemeni civil war that are not otherwise subject to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force [AUMF] or the 2003 AUMF in Iraq,” the resolution says. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who co-sponsored the document with Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), also drew attention to the fact that what the US military is doing goes beyond its authorized capacity.“What our military is not authorized to do is assist the Saudi Arabian regime in fighting the Houthis,” Khanna said, as cited by Politico. He also claimed that Washington’s aid to Saudi Arabia runs counter to its own stated goals in the region.“In many cases, the Saudis have aligned with Al-Qaeda to fight the Houthis, undermining our very counterterrorism operations,” he said. The document itself also states that “the conflict between the Saudi-led Arab Coalition and the Houthi… alliance is counterproductive to ongoing efforts by the United States to pursue Al-Qaeda and its associated forces.”Khanna, also a member of the House Armed Services Committee, has previously accused Washington of contributing to Saudi airstrikes “that kill civilians” and “are creating a security vacuum that allows groups like ISIS [Islamic State/IS, also ISIL] to gain a foothold.”By aiding the Saudis in airstrikes that kill civilians, we are creating a security vacuum that allows groups like ISIS to gain a foothold.The resolution adopted 366-30 on Monday is, however, largely symbolic and does not call for an immediate stop to US military aid to the Saudi-led coalition. Khanna particularly criticized the US interventions in the Middle East by saying that they had not “made the United States or the world any safer.” In a Twitter post he also called on Washington to embrace “a foreign policy of restraint and diplomacy.”Our interventionism in the Middle East has not made the United States or the world any safer. Instead of calling for regime change, we need a foreign policy of restraint and diplomacy.Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on lawmakers to “sunset the 2001 AUMF,” adding that the document had never been intended to be “a blank check,” Politico reports. The 2001 AUMF authorized the US president to use military force against “nations, organizations, or persons” that are considered to be in any way linked to the 9/11 attacks, to prevent further terrorist assaults on the country.The authorization has been used numerous times to justify military action against Afghanistan, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, Iraq, Kenya, Libya, Philippines, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, according to the Congressional Research Service. There were calls to halt US support for the Gulf countries fighting in Yemen even before the Monday resolution. Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) said in June that it was “astounding what’s going on in Yemen]” with US weapons, during a debate on American arms sales to Saudi Arabia.Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California and a long-time advocate for the suspension of US cooperation with the Saudi-led coalition, also said earlier this year that Washington should not increase its involvement in the Yemeni civil war “without any explanation” by the president.Since March 2015, the UN has recorded a total of 13,504 civilian casualties in Yemen, including 4,971 killed and 8,533 injured. Yemen’s conflict has also brought one of the region’s poorest countries to the brink of famine."
"RT America has been forced to register as a 'foreign agent' in the US. The pressure from Washington began after US intelligence claimed the channel was an instrument for meddling and manipulation in America.RT files for registration as ‘foreign agent’ in US facing ultimatum from WashingtonIn September, the Justice Department demanded RT register as a foreign agent. Social media companies then began blocking its adverts on such networks as Google, YouTube, and Twitter. They did that ahead of testimony in Congress, despite having no problem with RT before that.But why is RT facing such unprecedented pressure from the US government and what are the possible consequences of this latest move?""It is a slap at the First Amendment. We, here in America, are always proud of having free speech, meaning that we weren’t going to suppress any kind of comments by anybody, even if we didn’t like them. That was our fundamental principle... Now that is pretty much a slap in the face. If we’re going to have TV stations like RT, who are funded by the Russians [register as foreign agents], why aren’t we going to force the BBC or other TV stations that are funded by countries to register also? We have no consistency in this – except we are selectively suppressing any kind of speech. That to me is a direct violation of our First Amendment to the Constitution.""""One thing I’d just point out that is distinctive about RT – I have to admit this, and this is this: RT has never asked me for a pre-interview interview. CBS, ABC, NBC, Al Jazeera – they all say: “Can we figure out what you’re going to say, Mr. McGovern? Would you tell us what you’re going to say?” Sometimes BBC said: “Oh, we don’t need to hear that. We have somebody else.” RT has never asked: “What’s your gloss on this? What would you say about this?” All they do is say; “Here is the link, Mr. McGovern. We know you might know something about it. Please come on.” That is distinctive. And that is why I rejoice being asked to at least to talk to the people, who are smart enough to watch RT.""‘CNN should register as agent of capitalism’: Green Party VP hits out at RT ‘foreign agent’ tag https://t.co/fCwPBgIwOPpic.twitter.com/wP8gBDobgcGG: It’s dark and dangerous path, and we don’t know how far that path will now go. It is the branding of journalists as agents. That is very dangerous for the safety of journalists in many hot spots and difficult parts of the world…Al Jazeera America was broadcasting freely and openly for many years in the US, even though the political line of Al Jazeera in places like Syria, for example, was deeply controversial, to say the very least. If we’re going to brand one group of journalists and broadcasters as foreign agents then inevitably all journalists will be branded by somebody as foreign agents…The British Prime Minister just hours ago made similar noises unexpectedly. No one was expecting the statement that she just made. But if you follow the logic of the path that many British parliamentarians are now on - Theresa May is the prime minister because of Russia after all, if Putin fixed Brexit and Brexit ditched Cameron, then Theresa May is the prime minister because of the Russians. I’ll tell you what: if that turns out to be true – I’ll for one never forgive you!RT:Is there a concerted effort to push RT out of the US? It's been removed from YouTube's premium package in the US, blocked from advertising on Twitter, etc. Now, this…GG: Despite the fact that both – Google at the Congress and the others admitted that RT and Russia have broken none of the rules on the platform, but this package has not been yet reinstated on YouTube. Yes, of course except that in the 21st century – 17 years, almost 18 years – you can’t block coverage; you can’t block people consuming coverage in the modern world, but you can make it more difficult, and that seems to be where the US and maybe even the UK is headed.But again you see with the 21st-century psychology – the book they try to ban always goes to the top of the best sellers list. The more difficult they try to make it, the more popular RT is becoming. People wear it as a kind of badge. Maybe I should get a badge – I am a foreign agent. It might become trendy; it might well backfire on the witch hunters – the people who are doing their best to destroy the very freedom of speech and expression they claim to stand for.Ken Livingstone: The problem is that RT broadcast news that is true that American governments don’t want people to hear. Every evening I flip backward and forwards between BBC and RT, and Sky – every television channel has some sort of reflection of its national interest – it is inevitable.But if I think back to what I saw on American television in the 1960s and 70s about the Vietnam War – it was an appalling level of bias and all of that. What I found very helpful about RT – it is telling us much more about what is happening in a horrific war in Yemen that you ever see on Western televisions. Western governments are trying to suppress the news of what Saudi Arabia is doing.RT: To what extent will this latest step further damage bilateral relations between Russia and the US?KL: We had this sort of attempt to demonize Putin’s regime. We’re told endless lies about what happened in Ukraine, in Crimea, and so on. I almost never find anywhere in the Western media the truth about what happened in Ukraine and in Crimea, and what the origins in the past of all that are. Basically to understand today’s politics you really have to understand some history as well. Broadly, what you get on American television is almost like adverts, rather than a serious historical analysis.RT:What does this move say about the state of press freedom in the US?KL: The idea that there is a free press is nonsense. Here in Britain and certainly in America so many of the newspapers are owned by billionaires who don’t pay their tax locally, launder their money offshore - they are not really representing the American people, they are just making a lot of money themselves...I just think myself, when I was questioning the British government’s policy under Mrs. Thatcher about what they were doing in Northern Ireland – the BBC was told that I should be on their television. For about 18 months I wasn’t interviewed at all…"
"In a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that Sessions ""has directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters.""The letters referenced - written by Goodlatte - were dated July 27 and September 26, and included requests by him and other committee members that a special counsel be appointed to investigate certain matters, some of which involved Clinton, according to Fox News.Among the issues raised was the 2010 Uranium One deal, approved by Clinton when she served as secretary of state in President Barack Obama's administration. That deal involved selling part of a Canadian-based mining company to Rosatom, resulting in the company acquiring control over 20 percent of America's uranium supply.Some Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have claimed - without providing evidence - that Russian interests sought to donate to the Clinton Foundation in a bid to persuade Clinton to support the deal.Trump has claimed that Clinton was ""paid a fortune"" to facilitate the sale, and has slammed the ""fake media"" for ignoring ""one of the big stories of the decade.""Those claims have been denied by Clinton, who called them ""baloney"" and said there has been ""no credible evidence [presented] by anyone.""Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!Prosecutors will be assigned to the matters as requested, according to the letter, and will report to Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. In particular, they will ""make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened,” or whether a special counsel will be needed, states the letter, which was delivered ahead of a committee oversight hearing at which Sessions will appear on Tuesday.The document adds that some issues requested by Goodlatte and other committee members are already being investigated by the Inspector General's Office. Once the IG’s review is complete, the Department will assess what, if any, additional steps are necessary to address any issues identified by that review. However, the Justice Department does not typically confirm or deny specific investigations, and Boyd stressed that the letter ""should not be construed to do so."""

WikiLeaks appears to beguile some people into transparency by convincing them that it is in their interest. 4/The exchanges show that Wikileaks reached out to Trump Jr., offering him the password to an anti-Trump PAC’s website they suggested he should look into. The whistleblower site told Trump Jr. to visit the site’s “About” section to see who was behind the effort.“Off the record I don’t know who that is but I’ll ask around,” Trump Jr. wrote the next day. “Thanks.”According to the Atlantic, Trump Jr. then emailed all the senior members of the Trump campaign to inform them about the communication.In addition to #Wikileaks & Assange DMs, Senate request includes any information on the hacker Guccifer https://t.co/z8KGUYuDwvpic.twitter.com/YXGYp2ALfjOn October 3, 2016, Wikileaks sent another message to Trump Jr., asking him to push a story that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike the WikiLeaks founder, Assange.“Already did that earlier today. It’s amazing what she can get away with,” Trump Jr. wrote back.Minutes later, Trump Jr. asked about an upcoming leak that he was hearing about at the time.“What’s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?” Trump Jr. wrote.Wikileaks did not respond until after the site posted thousands of emails from Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta on October 7.On October 12, five days later, Trump Jr. received another DM from the Twitter account with a link to all of the Podesta emails. The account suggested that Trump Jr. should tell his followers to dig through the content.“There's many great stories there the press are missing and we're sure some of your followers will find it,” Wikileaks wrote.On October 14, Trump Jr. tweeted the link that Wikileaks sent him, telling his followers who had the time to “read about all the corruption and hypocrisy.”For those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the @wikileaks emails are right here: https://t.co/SGcEeM9rCSThe communication appears to show that Trump Jr. did not have any advanced knowledge of the hacked emails, something the Trump campaign has been accused of in the past.The Wikileaks account sent several more messages to Trump Jr. over the following months, asking him to leak one or more of his father’s tax returns to the site, advising his father not to concede if he lost the election, and asking if he could use his political powers to “suggest that Australia appoint Assange ambassador” to Washington DC.“They won’t do it, but it will send the right signals to Australia, UK + Sweden to start following the law and stop bending it to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons,” Wikileaks wrote.Trump Jr. did not respond to any of the further DMs. However, Trump Jr. seemed to listen when Wikileaks said they were “very interested” in leaking an email exchange he had with a Russian lawyer who had incriminating information about the Democrats.“We think this is strongly in your interest. Why? Because otherwise your opponents (who clearly have a copy) will gradually 'milk' phrases from the email(2) with their own spin/context added according to what suits THEIR timing and THEIR strategy,” Wikileaks wrote. “Us publishing not only deprived them of this ability but is beautifully confounding.”Later that same day, Trump Jr. posted the full content of the emails on his Twitter account, saying the meeting turned out to be “the most inane nonsense I ever heard.”Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ"
"The San Francisco, California-based court overrode US District Judge Derrick Watson of Hawaii, who sought to block the ban by declaring it violates immigration law by discriminating on the basis of nationality. Trump’s executive order, issued on September 24, indefinitely restricted travel to the US for citizens from eight countries: Somalia, Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, North Korea, Venezuela and Chad.Ninth Circuit issues partial stay in Travel Ban 3.0 case pic.twitter.com/1br9Gw1AmHWatson ordered a block of the order on October 17. He was joined by US District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, who sought to block the policy on grounds of Constitutional prohibitions against religious discrimination. The ban affects six Muslim-majority countries.Chuang’s ruling still needs to be addressed by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Richmond, Virginia-based court has scheduled a full-bench hearing for December 8.The September 24 executive order is the third travel ban to come out of the White House since January. Trump has justified the decision by citing security requirements and lack of proper information-sharing and vetting procedures in the countries affected. Critics, however, pointed to his campaign trail proposal to enact ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.""Several individual plaintiffs, refugee resettlement organizations, human rights groups and a number of states with Democratic attorneys-general have challenged the travel bans from the beginning, arguing that Trump’s campaign statement disqualifies him from barring Muslims from entering the US.Both the 4th and the 9th Circuit courts have generally been favorable to the challengers. In June, the US Supreme Court overrode both appeals courts and allowed the second ban to go into effect, but carved out an exemption for persons with “bona fide relationships” in the US. The extent of that definition has since been hotly disputed in both district and circuit courts.Under the 9th Circuit’s interpretation on Monday, “Such persons include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins.”“As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading [Proclamation 9645],” the court added."
"“He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!” Trump said in a tweet announcing the nomination on Monday morning.If confirmed by the Senate, Azar would fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. Tom Price in late September, amid criticism over spending $1 million of taxpayer money on air travel. Acting secretary Eric Hargan currently runs the department.Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary. He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!The HHS is a prominent posting in the Trump administration, as the president seeks to repeal, replace or rework the current healthcare mandate passed under the Obama administration. Trump’s campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare this year foundered in the Senate due to the monolithic opposition of Democrats and dissent from several Republican lawmakers.“I’m not one to say many good things about Obamacare, but one of the nice things in it is it does give a tremendous amount authority to the secretary,” Azar said during an interview with Bloomberg TV in June. “There are still changes that can be made to make it work a little better than it has been.”From 2011 to January 2017, Azar was president of Lilly USA, the largest affiliate of global pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company. Azar joined the company in 2007, after serving as deputy secretary of HHS in the George W. Bush administration. From 2009 to 2011 he was senior vice president of Lilly's global corporate affairs and communications division.In the 1990s, Azar worked as a clerk under Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and on the investigation of Bill Clinton’s Whitewater real estate investments, under independent counsel Kenneth Starr.Price, a former congressman from Georgia, resigned on September 29 amid criticism that he spent more than $1 million on flights for him and his wife. More than $500,000 of that sum was spent on overseas military flights to Africa, Europe and Asia. Price also chartered private planes for at least 24 domestic flights to cities where low-cost commercial alternatives were available.“I was disappointed because I didn't like it cosmetically or otherwise,” Trump said at the time. “This is an administration that saves hundreds of millions of dollars on renegotiating things.""Following Price’s resignation, Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Mick Mulvaney sent out a  memo to Trump administration officials with new rules for using government funds for travel. Mulvaney reminded department heads that they are ""public servants"" and that money they spend comes from the taxpayers."
"Trump was in Manila for the opening ceremony of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations conference (ASEAN). His struggle started when the world leaders and top officials joined a traditional ‘ASEAN handshake’ for a group photo. Trump was supposed to cross arms and join hands with the men on either side of him, but this didn’t go smoothly for the US president.While others clutched the hands of those to their left and right, Trump used both of his hands to clasp the fingers of Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, standing to his right. On Trump’s other side, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was left standing with a spare hand.Finally, the US president realised that he had broken the link aimed at showing unity between ASEAN members. Laughing and grimacing, he crossed his arms and reached to the correct sides. The traditional ASEAN cross handshake was also apparently too complicated for Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, but he chose not to break the ‘unity’ chain and shook hands the traditional way.READ MORE: 6 of Trump’s most cringeworthy handshakes… so far (VIDEOS)Trump’s handshakes have become a sort of trademark in recent months. Trump held on to the hand of French President Emmanuel Macron for a staggering 28 seconds during their meeting in Paris last July. In February, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visibly relieved when the US leader finally released his hand after another intense grip in front of the cameras."
"In an interview on CBS News’ Face the Nation on Sunday, the treasury secretary commented on President Trump’s remarks, in which he said he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin was sincere in denying the allegations of meddling in the 2016 election. Mnuchin argued that the US public was “ready to move on” from the issue.“Let me be clear, nobody thinks this has had any impact on the election. So whatever occurred, there was no impact,” he said. “So I think the American public is ready to move on to more important issues: tax reform and foreign policy and national security.”Face the Nation host John Dickerson responded that on “the national security front, people think this is an enemy. We should behave with them as such.” And then he moved on with the interview.Earlier, Trump made another one of his famous flip-flops over the allegations. First he said he believes that when Putin told him Russia had not interfered in the election, the Russian leader “meant it.” Hours later, he expressed his trust in the US intelligence community, which said it was certain that Moscow had a hand in the election.Russia adamantly denies the allegations and believes it is being used as a scapegoat by Democrats to explain Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss to Trump. The narrative is currently prominent in the US media and was cited by US lawmakers as the reason for imposing additional sanctions on Russia. This latest round sparked outrage in some European countries, which said the US was blatantly targeting Russian projects to push Russian companies out of the European market.Mnuchin, the person charged with implementing the restrictions, stressed that his department was “absolutely carrying out the sanctions.” At the same time, he noted that the US should stop focusing solely on restrictions against Russia, and “move on” to more pressing issues, such as North Korea and Syria, which particularly require Washington “to get along” with Moscow. He also refrained from commenting on the intelligence related to the alleged Russia meddling that he had being briefed on as part of the Trump administration."
"With tensions running high over North Korea, Trump mocked his nemesis Kim, deviously calling him “short and fat,” after Pyongyang’s spokesman dubbed Trump a “dotard.”“Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?” Trump tweeted Saturday from Vietnam, as he continues his 12-day Asian tour. “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend – and maybe someday that will happen!”Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ""old,"" when I would NEVER call him ""short and fat?"" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!Trump’s Asian tour has not been welcomed by the North Koreans, who view his visit to the region as a diplomatic effort to garner enough support to attack North Korea.“Trump, during his visit, laid bare his true nature as destroyer of the world peace and stability and begged for a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula,” a spokesperson for the DPRK Foreign Ministry said Saturday. “The reckless remarks by a dotard like Trump can never frighten us or put a stop to our advance.”Pyongyang was responding to Trump's statements made during his visit to South Korea Wednesday, where he said North Korea is “ruled as a cult,” based on a “deranged belief in the leader’s destiny to rule.”This is not the first time the leaders exchange ‘pleasantries’ about each other. Trump has repeatedly called Kim a “rocket man” while “dotard” has been used by the North Korean leader to reference Trump on more than one occasion.“I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire,” Kim said in September, after the US president, in his maiden address at the UN, called Kim a “rocket man.”Trump calls Kim Jong-un ‘Rocket Man’ after call with South Korean leader“The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,” the US president said in his address. “Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself.”“A frightened dog barks louder,” Kim yapped back. “Action is the best option in treating the dotard who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say.”North Korea calls Trump ‘mentally ill’ in propaganda leaflets dropped over Seoul (IMAGES)Becoming friends with Kim would be ""very, very nice"" but he was not sure if it would ever happen, Trump clarified while talking to the press later Sunday. “That might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility,” he said, standing beside Vietnamese president Tran Dai Quang. “If it did happen, it could be a good thing I can tell you, for North Korea... But it could also be good for a lot of other places and be good for the rest the world.”"
"“When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,” Trump wrote, emphasizing, that “playing politics” instead of moving forward to resolve high-priority issues is “bad for our country.”When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!Trump also said he had “good discussions” with President Vladimir Putin during their brief encounters at the APEC summit in Vietnam, where they, despite disagreements, managed to produce a joint statement on Syria.“Hope for his [Putin’s] help to solve, along with China the dangerous North Korea crisis. Progress being made,” Trump tweeted.Met with President Putin of Russia who was at #APEC meetings. Good discussions on Syria.

Couldn't have it, because he didn't have chemistry. They didn't have the right chemistry,” the US leader said.Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin."
"Following three brief encounters between the Russian and US presidents on the grounds of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam, Trump shared his insights with reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday. President Putin appears to be “very insulted” by the allegations of Russian involvement in the 2016 US presidential election, according to Trump, which “is not a good thing for our country,” he added.“Every time he [Putin] sees me, he says I didn’t do that, and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,” Trump stated. He added that a number of former intelligence community chiefs acted merely as “political hacks,” fueling the ‘Russian meddling’ narrative.“You hear it's 17 agencies. Well, it's three. … They're political hacks,” the US president said. “Everybody knows there was no collusion. I mean, you speak to these people... I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day and I respect her. She was on television the other day saying there's no collusion. The Democrats - the Republicans come out screaming it, but the Democrats come out, and they say, ‘No, there's no collusion.’ There is no collusion. There's nothing.”The persisting hysteria around Moscow’s alleged involvement in the US election is a “Democratic hit job,” preventing the two countries from engaging in any meaningful cooperation, Trump said. He cited the joint US-Russia statement on Syria, delivered by the two presidents during the summit, as an example of such fruitful cooperation, which could be possible without the overblown scandal around the alleged ‘Russian meddling.’“When we can save many, many, many lives by making a deal with Russia having to do with Syria, and then ultimately getting Syria solved, and getting Ukraine solved, and doing other things, having a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing,” Trump said. “And this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way. It gets in the way. And that’s a shame. Because people will die because of it, and it’s a pure hit job, and it’s artificially induced. And that’s shame.”READ MORE: On the same page?

Adam Schiff said Trump “fools no one.” CIA Director Mike Pompeo also reiterated that he “stands by, and has always stood by” the January assessment by the intelligence community which pointed accusatory fingers at Russia.The narrative of alleged collusion between Moscow and Trump has been persisting in US media for about a year already. The illicit activities attributed to Russia, include, but not limited to, “hacking” into Democratic National Committee (DNC) computers during the electoral campaign, leaking emails filled with unsavory revelations and meddling through media coverage. The DNC emails were released by WikiLeaks, while Russia was accused of supplying the whistleblower website with the allegedly “hacked” materials. Washington's claims were widely publicized, but not a shred of evidence was provided to substantiate the allegations. WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange firmly denied any Russian involvement in the DNC data leak, emphasizing that its “source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party.” While the investigation into Moscow’s alleged wrongdoings has not yield any solid evidence, the lingering ‘meddling’ saga has rapidly worsened already strained Russia-US relations.Moscow has repeatedly denied any meddling in the US election, stating that the accusations against Russia were only a pretext, masking an internal political struggle in the US. “These are merely rumors that are being used in US political in-fighting,” Putin said in May."
"Now retired, Lt. Gen. Jan-Marc Jouas gave his views on a possible conflict with North Korea in a letter to Representatives Ted Lieu (D-CA), Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona), and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois) earlier this week.Jouas, formerly deputy commander of US Forces Korea, said the near 30,000-strong US forces stationed in the neighboring South would struggle to counter the North Korean Army, which the country claims almost 5 million people have volunteered for.“The 28,500 US Armed Forces personnel in South Korea are vastly outnumbered by North Korean forces,as well as ROK (South Korean) forces that will conduct the overwhelming majority of the fighting,” he wrote.Jouas also stressed that unlike previous conflicts, the US would not be able build up its forces prior to engagement with the North Koreans, stating that it “will take days to months to arrive in theater [of war].”In the meantime, the 25 million inhabitants of the South Korean capital, Seoul would be in grave danger from the enemy to the north and that US and allied forces would be “subject to attack by conventional or chemical weapons” which would further delay their entry into the war.The retired general, who was “deeply involved” with developing plans to counter any potential attacks on South Korea from the North, warned that despite the US’ clear technological advantage, the sheer number of North Korean troops, coupled with the country’s “artillery, rockets and missiles,” would result in an “enormous casualty and evacuee crisis.”Furthermore, the North Korean submarine force, “although technically inferior,” is among the largest in the world and “capable of sinking allied vessels, sowing mines and inserting Special Forces units.” There’s also the small matter of the country deploying unknown quantities of nuclear weapons against its enemies.#NorthKorea launches first 3 missiles since nuke threats row with US https://t.co/3ldJBo0Mi5Jouas believes that there’s no such thing as a surgical strike designed to knock out North Korea’s nuclear capabilities and that any US attack, “no matter how limited,” would result in a full-scale war.“An attack by the US on North Korea’s strategic nuclear capabilities, which they deem essential to the regime’s survival, would most likely be viewed as an existential threat and generate a corresponding response,” he wrote.The letter comes just days after thousands of South Koreans flocked to the streets of Seoul to demand peace with North Korea and protest the visit by US President Donald Trump, who previously promised to unleash “fire and fury” against the “rocket man,” Kim Jong-un.  "
"Kiriakou, who spent two-and-a-half years in jail for exposing the CIA’s torture program in 2007, was invited to address the European Parliament on national security whistleblowing Wednesday. However, he was bounced from the panel at the last minute, because one of the other panelists objected to his presence.Addressing the European Parliament today on national security whistleblowing with @medeabenjamin, @SteliosKoul, and other lovers of freedom.Kiriakou told RT he “thought it was a joke” when Winnie Wong, co-founder of the progressive organization, People for Bernie, refused to appear on the panel with him, because “she didn’t want the appearance of Bernie Sanders appearing to endorse the Russian media.”“I laughed when she first said it because it was so ridiculous that I thought she was joking,” Kiriakou said. “Then she walked away, and one of the aides handed me an updated schedule, and my name then, was not associated with the first panel.”Wong told Kiriakou she already “ran it up the flagpole” with her organization which supports the independent US Senator from Vermont, and they told her not to appear on the panel with him.“While they were supportive of me as a person, as an individual, and supportive of the fact that I blew the whistle on the CIA’s torture program, the fact that I was now associated with Russian media meant that they could not appear on this panel with me,” the whistleblower said.Kiriakou, who hosts a radio show called Loud & Clear on Sputnik Radio, said before he could even process what was going on, he was whisked away to a television studio, where he was told to do a one-on-one interview for Greek national television.“It wasn’t until I was doing the television interview that I finally said to the MEP, ‘wait a minute, did I get thrown off that panel?’” Kiriakou said.Organizers said the decision to remove him from the panel was because they “didn’t want to make a problem with the other guests.”“And I thought ‘Wow. Okay. American politics rears its ugly head in Brussels,’” Kiriakou said.He said there were no problems when he appeared on another panel with the Cuban ambassador to the EU and several other members of the European Parliament.""It's a lie that torture of prisoners has saved American lives. The CIA has repeated it over and over again."" #Whistleblower@JohnKiriakoupic.twitter.com/puJON2zMt1The ex-CIA officer said the current state of American politics feels like “a red scare all over again,” adding, that politicians are once again looking at Russians as “the bad guys for absolutely everything.”“They feel they can’t even risk even a tangential association with the Russians or with anything Russian for fear of being branded by their political opponents. It’s ridiculous. It smacks of the 1950s to tell you the truth,” Kiriakou said.However, unlike the 1950s, Kiriakou said the Democrats are the ones “leading this anti-Russian charge.”“We see it in the media, we see it on CNN, and Fox and MSNBC, it’s not the Republicans, so it’s like Role-reversal compared to what we saw in the 1950s,” Kiriakou noted. He warned that it’s only the “very beginning of this whole process.”“This is only going to get worse as we move our way closer and closer to national elections here,” Kiriakou said. “If you don’t participate in this mantra of the Russians being behind every problem in the United States, you’re weak on Russia and you’re un-American and that’s what we’re seeing now being laid as groundwork.”Kiriakou said the “single most important point” about the current animosity toward Russia is that the Intelligence Community has provided “literally zero evidence” to support their claims that Russia meddled in the 2016 US presidential election.He pointed to the fact that the intelligence community has previously been caught lying about the CIA torture program; the extraordinary rendition kidnapping program; the secret prison systems; and hacking into the Senate Intelligence Committee’s computer systems“Now they tell us that Russia is behind Trump’s election and Hillary Clinton’s loss,” Kiriakou said. “They tell us to take their word for it. Well, why in the world would we take their word for it, when everything else they’ve told us is a lie?”‘String of brain-dead slogans’ – Social media reactions to RT’s foreign agent registration https://t.co/uTWYlMtnBcpic.twitter.com/RN8s8oLjmWKiriakou said the Justice Department demanding RT to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was simply a “brash political move” by the Democrats.“This has nothing to do with the fact that RT is a representative of a foreign government, there are lots of different organizations here in Washington that are representatives of foreign governments,” Kiriakou said. “This is very specifically anti-Russian. It has nothing to  do with the news, and instead, it has only to do with domestic American politics.”"
"The ""United Nations Voting Accountability Act of 2017"" has been put forward by Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Steve King (R-IA) and referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The lawmakers want to legally ""prohibit United States assistance to foreign countries that oppose the position of the United States at the United Nations.""Any ""monetary or physical assistance"" including economic support and military cooperation should be suspended for those international players that consistently vote against the US in the UN Security Council and the General Assembly, the document states. If a UN member state’s position is not the same as Washington's in more than 50 percent of the recorded voting, it should be considered an ""opposed"" country.Once there is ""a fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the government of a country"" that has been deprived of US support due to its voting practices, the assistance might be renewed, the bill adds. Another exclusion example would be the president's decision to delete a country from the ""prohibition"" list based on US national security interests. However, even in this case, a US leader should explain the motivation to Congress.The US State Department has been annually submitting a report on voting practices in the UN starting from 1984, claiming that ""a country's behavior at the United Nations is always relevant to its bilateral relationship."" The latest report, for instance, shows that based on overall voting in the General Assembly in 2015, North Korea, Syria, Iran and Cuba have a lower percentage of ""voting coincidence with the US"": 11.1, 16.7, 18.6 and 26.4 respectively.On the other hand, those states who are highly unlikely to be deprived of US assistance, are Israel (94.3 percent of the voting coincidence), Canada (92.2) and Ukraine (76.5). Russian and American positions in the 2015 General Assembly coincided in 40.3 percent of the plenary votes.READ MORE: US quits UNESCO: ‘Israel setting agenda for Trump, Trump falls into line’While Washington has never expressed willingness to cooperate with countries that do not support its stance on international issues, the new document is worrying as it aims to secure such an approach legislatively, an expert on international humanitarian and political relations told RT Russian.

"Putin and Trump are taking part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) international summit, hosted by Vietnam on November 10-11. The Kremlin and the White House sent conflicting reports on a possible meeting between the two leaders, before finally signaling that it will not happen within the official format.However, even before some clarity on the issue emerged, Tillerson questioned the very necessity of the Russian and US presidents meeting at present. During a press briefing in Beijing on Thursday, he said that “a formal bilat [bilateral meeting]” at the summit had never been agreed on though the presidents could talk as “some kind of a pull-aside.”“The question is whether we've got sufficient substance,” Tillerson told reporters. ""And we have been in contact with [the Russians], and the view has been if the two leaders are going to meet, is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting?”Answering journalists’ questions, he noted however that Russia and the US share “a significant effort in the Middle East and in Ukraine,” but the countries need to achieve considerable progress on the issues to make the leaders’ meeting useful.“And we'd like to know, if the two heads of state are going to meet, is there something we can point to that's useful to meet. Otherwise, we'll just keep working it,” Tillerson stated.The White House said on Friday that the official meeting will not happen due to “scheduling conflicts,” while Moscow said that the leaders will meet “one way or another.”The uncertainty about the meeting irritated Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who suggested journalists press the American side on the comments.“We have heard about US President Trump’s wish to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was expressed by Trump himself,” Lavrov said in Friday. “I don’t know what his pen-pushers are saying, ask them.”Trump told Fox News last week that he may meet Putin during his Asian tour as the Russian leader is “very important” in helping with Syria and North Korea.“And, again – Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea. They can help us with Syria. We have to talk about Ukraine,” Trump said.While it is currently unclear when Trump and Putin will have another opportunity to speak face-to-face, their first-ever meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg last July was described as productive and welcomed by both sides. As a result of that meeting, Russia and the US reached a “breakthrough” ceasefire deal on Syria, which was announced shortly after the presidents’ talks.Tillerson was optimistic about Russian-US cooperation on the Syrian issue following the presidents’ meeting in July. ""I think this is our first indication of the US and Russia being able to work together in Syria, and as a result of that we had a very lengthy discussion regarding other areas in Syria that we can continue to work together on to de-escalate the areas,"" he said.Russian-American relations are currently at their lowest point since the Cold War. In July, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called on Moscow and Washington to restore trust because the world is “tired of the tension.”"
"Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee released their tax bill Thursday, drawing sharp contrasts with the House version. President Donald Trump expects to sign the tax reform bill into law this year, but that will depend on whether the GOP can iron out their internal wrinkles in time.A major difference in the two GOP bills is the issue of state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The Senate’s version eliminates the SALT deduction completely, with taxpayers losing the opportunity to deduct their state and local property, along with other taxes, from their federal filing.House Republicans set forth only a partial repeal of SALT in their model, allowing for $10,000 in property taxes to be deducted. Senate Republicans are reportedly not willing to compromise on this issue, citing revenue concerns.If the Senate and the House end up disagreeing on key issues, they will have to form what is called a “conference committee” to negotiate and create a new bill that both the Senate and the House will have to pass in their respective chambers. Or, alternatively, one chamber could legally take the other assembly’s bill and pass that piece of legislation, which would result in that being the final tax bill.Both the Senate and the House look to drop the top corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, but the Senate's version of the legislation would not lower the rate until 2019, one year after the House bill’s date. The Senate’s delayed cut is supposed to help avoid an exploding deficit, but critics argue that economic growth will be stunted by the deferral.The Senate bill also differs from the House bill in relation to the current seven US tax brackets.The Senate’s proposals keeps the current system intact, but lowers the top category from 39 percent to 38.5 percent.In an effort to simplify the tax code, the House's version looks to cut the seven brackets down to four, which will end up costing $1 trillion over the next decade. This will happen because some tax filers, specifically those earning between roughly $500,000 to $1 million each year, will pay less in taxes, according to the Washington Post.READ MORE: Sen.

"Russophobia is costing American taxpayers a bundle of money, and US politicians and defense contractors couldn’t be happier.Tucked deep inside the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, under a category entitled, “Countering Russian Aggression,” $4.6 billion is casually set aside for the so-called European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) to “reassure NATO allies and enhance the U.S. deterrent and defense postures in Europe.”Further on, the NDAA calls for $350 million to “provide security assistance to Ukraine, including defensive lethal assistance.” The idea of sending lethal arms to Ukraine, where a civil war is smoldering on Russia’s border, could encourage Kiev once again to resort to violence in a further attempt to resolve the standoff.The explanation given for this intense ratcheting-up of military hardware on Russia’s border is the same one that Washington and Brussels have been selling to NATO members for many years: “Russia’s ongoing aggressive actions — including its invasions of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014; threats to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies; rapid military modernization; advanced anti-access and area denial capabilities; increasing military activity in the Arctic region and Mediterranean Sea; evolving nuclear doctrine and capabilities...”The problem with that explanation is that it is comprised of either bare-faced lies or gross exaggerations, immediately obvious to anyone with a clear picture of the game. Yet that is exactly what so many mainstream news consumers lack – a clear picture. As a result US lawmakers, in cahoots with defense contractors, are able to pursue such dangerous machinations with impunity.The West relies on the belief that most people would never bother to fact-check the claim that “Russia invaded Ukraine,” for example, which is a patent falsehood. Nor would they discover that the only reason “Russian invaded Georgia” is that Georgia launched a deadly attack on Russian peacekeepers during its offensive on South Ossetia on August 7, 2008. Despite a comprehensive EU investigation that concluded former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili was to blame for starting the war with Russia, EU leaders continue to shamelessly sell the myth of 'Russian aggression' to their constituents.Today, US-Russia relations have deteriorated to levels not seen since the Cold War standoff. And it must be said that for whatever differences there may have been between the Obama and Trump administrations, and there were many, the one thing that both have in common is their willingness to pack the former Eastern Bloc with US military hardware.Last summer, under Obama, NATO members agreed to the alliance boosting its military footprint in Europe to levels not seen since the Cold War – posting four rotating, multinational battalions to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.NATO launches new multinational force in Romania to counter Russia https://t.co/QKzbfRWLTkIn January, just before Trump’s inauguration, some 2,800 pieces of US military hardware – including Abrams tanks, Paladin artillery and Bradley fighting vehicles – and 4,000 troops rolled into Europe as part of the operation.Even non-NATO member Sweden played host to around 2,000 foreign troops, more than 1,400 of whom are from the US, according to the local Sydöstran newspaper. NATO members Denmark, Estonia, France, Lithuania, and Norway are also participating, as well as non-aligned Finland. Trump has done nothing to reverse the trend – in fact, he is encouraging it. Meanwhile Moscow, which has been forced to respond to this swift militarization on its borders, was criticized last month by Western capitals for holding joint Russian-Belarusian ‘Zapad-2017’ drills.Russian Major General Igor Konashenkov said the US military could easily redeploy its military personnel from the German Ramstein base to Poland within just two hours. He also countered NATO efforts to downplay the amount of hardware accumulating on Russia’s border.“In contrast to the claims of NATO and the US on the insignificance of the troops approaching the Russian border, in fact now it is not a brigade there but a US mechanized military division,” he said.Amassing such military power on Russian borders violates the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, he emphasized.NATO officials, however, dismissed the Russian ministry’s claims.Meanwhile, Vladimir Shamanov, head of the Russian State Duma’s Defense Committee and a former Airborne Troops commander, said Russia has many options – including the deployment of Iskander-M tactical missile systems to the Kaliningrad exclave – as the US-led military bloc continues to push up on its borders, he told TASS. Whatever response Russia decides to make, it can be sure that the current wave of Russophobia, echoing through the halls of Washington and now enshrined in America’s NDAA, will not disappear anytime soon.It can only be hoped that Europe will heed the advice of German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who warned in an interview that should Moscow and Washington fail to mend ties, “our children will be growing up in a dangerous and uncertain world increasingly armed with nuclear weapons.” If that comment doesn't make the EU sit up and take notice, nothing will."
"On Wednesday, House and Senate lawmakers agreed on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the Fiscal Year 2018, which includes a whole chapter titled “Countering Russian Aggression.” The bill was earlier proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and submitted by Senator John McCain (R-Arizona).In response to what the bill calls Russia’s “ongoing aggressive actions,” the NDAA proposes to limit Moscow’s alleged interference in US and world affairs. That includes spending some $4.6 billion on countering the Russian “threat” in Europe, and $350 million on security aid for Ukraine, including “defensive lethal assistance.” A particularly controversial aspect of the bill is that, if the NDAA is signed into law, American cable and satellite networks would be able to lawfully refuse to provide services to RT, as well as any other channels allegedly linked to the Russian government.“A multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD), such as cable and satellite television providers, may not be required to carry video content from television stations to the extent that such content is owned, controlled, or financed by the Government of the Russian Federation,” the draft legislation states.Currently, the networks must comply with US federal law, and cannot drop a channel without facing legal consequences except in circumstances where obscene content was shown.The bill was slammed by Russian lawmakers, with the head of the State Duma’s International Affairs Committee Leonid Slutsky calling the move a “witch hunt” and saying that it makes Russia think about adequate retaliatory measures.“It is another manifestation of double standards and violation of freedom of speech, which has nothing to do with defending democratic values,” Slutsky said on Thursday. The senator added that US lawmakers are apparently afraid that Americans are able to get access to a point of view “different from the one that is imposed by American mainstream media.” READ MORE: Facebook, Google could help US ‘retaliate’ against Russia, other nations – Senator McConnell (VIDEO)At the same time, Head of the Russian Upper House Commission for Information Policy Senator Aleksey Pushkov called for discussions on possible restrictions on US media operating in Russia, and questioned “why the ‘Voice of America,’ any US media must be allowed to reach Russian customers.” Meanwhile, Moscow has vowed to retaliate against Washington’s actions to restrict Russian media, with Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova telling reporters on Thursday that “in all cases, related to pressure and persecution of the Russian media in the US, [Russia] will take appropriate measures.”Zakharova added that if Washington halts the work of Russian TV channels, including RT, or makes their work “virtually impossible,” Russia will use “the relevant articles of the law on mass media.”The bill is the latest ratcheting up of Washington’s pressure on Russian media. Last week, top House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff questioned whether RT should be allowed to advertise on social media such as Twitter and Facebook. The statement was preceded by hearings at the Senate Intelligence Committee, where the tech giants were grilled over alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election.In late October, just days before the hearings, Twitter banned ads from RT and Sputnik on its platform, citing the aforesaid alleged meddling. However, the social media platform itself offered RT a costly election ad-buy, as the ban drove the channel to reveal.In September, the US Department of Justice demanded that a contractor supplying various services for RT America register as a foreign agent, under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), or face consequences that could effectively stop work at their US offices. The legislation in question was adopted in the late 1930s to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and inform American citizens “of the source of information (propaganda) and the identity of persons attempting to influence US public opinion, policy, and laws.”Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned against restrictions on Russian media in the past, saying that Moscow “will act only symmetrically and quite swiftly.”"

"Reverting to Cold War-era policies, the restrictions announced Wednesday will prohibit most individual visits to Cuba, allowing US citizens to only visit the island as part of Treasury Department-licensed group tours. Americans will also be banned from staying at hotels, restaurants and other businesses that the State Department has determined are owned by or benefit Cuban officials.The restrictions, set to go into effect on Thursday, are “intended to steer economic activities away from the Cuban military, intelligence and security services,” an anonymous administration official told the Washington Post.Those who have “completed at least one travel-related transaction (such as purchasing a flight or reserving accommodations)” prior to the announcement of the new restrictions will still be able to visit Cuba, the Post reported.In December 2014, President Barack Obama said the five-decade-old US policy towards Cuba had failed, and so he began a process of normalizing relations, allowing US citizens to tour the country.

Later that month, mysterious stories surfaced of US diplomats in Cuba falling victim to bizarre “health attacks.” Reports have attributed hearing loss and brain injuries to the mysterious noises, with AP describing symptoms that were limited to specific rooms or parts of rooms.Cuban President Raul Castro has denied any responsibility for the diplomats’ ill health and invited the FBI to Havana to conduct their own investigation. Based on the sound files provided by AP, Cuban authorities have said the noises came from cicadas or crickets.Nonetheless, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and four other GOP senators sent a letter to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday, calling on the State Department to “immediately declare all accredited Cuban diplomats in the United States persona non grata and, if Cuba does not take tangible action, to close the US Embassy in Havana.”The US then ordered more than a half of its personnel working at the US Embassy in Havana to return home. The order was accompanied by a travel alert, advising its citizens against visiting Cuba."
"In an interview with RT America host Ed Schultz on Wednesday, Binney said tests have “clearly showed” the DNC was not hacked by Russia before the 2016 presidential election, but that the data was downloaded locally.Binney met with CIA director Mike Pompeo on Wednesday to review analysis by the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), which challenged the notion that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was hacked by Russia. In a letter to President Donald Trump, the group claims the “data was leaked (not hacked) by a person with physical access to DNC computers.”After analyzing the data, VIPS concluded that the transfer simply does not support the claim the documents were hacked by Russian agents, as leaders of the US intelligence community claimed in a January report.Binney also spoke with RT's Neil Harvey on Wednesday.During the meeting, Binney shared test findings gleaned on the transfer rate of data, which he said “clearly showed that it was a local download and not an international hack.”“It was very clear it was a local download, because of the speeds and all,” Binney said, explaining how his colleagues set up a test between a data center in New Jersey and another in the UK, and could not reproduce the download that took place on July 5, 2016.The approximately 16GB of data was downloaded in two bursts, totaling 87 seconds, with a 12-minute pause between them.“It had to be done locally,” Binney told RT America.The data logs and the speed test were the only concrete evidence available for examination, he pointed out. “Everything else is speculation, and agenda- and emotionally-driven assertions.”If the intelligence community had some factual evidence proving Russian hacking, that would be another matter, the NSA whistleblower said, but “so far they’ve produced nothing.”When asked who could have been behind the leak, Binney said it may have been an “inside job,” but he couldn’t attribute it to anybody in particular, because “we never knew who did the download, or whether or not it went anywhere else.”President John F. Kennedy presented aerial surveillance photos of Soviet missiles in Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis, Binney pointed out. Reagan presented Japanese radio intercepts of orders to shoot down the Korean airliner in 1983. No such evidence has been offered for the hacking accusation, though many lawmakers have described it as an act of war.“They need to put up or shut up,” said Binney. He said he does not buy into such claims without any factual evidence, “and that’s basically what their situation is. They have zero evidence.”However, if there was an agency who would be able to detect if the DNC was hacked, it would be the NSA, Binney said.“If anybody did anything across the net, NSA has so many taps on the fiber network inside the US and around the world and so many traceroute programs embedded by the hundreds around the network, they would know where these packets went,” Binney told RT America.The NSA and FBI “know a lot more than they're telling the president,” Binney added.The analysis from VIPS implies the intelligence community  is not telling the Trump administration what really happened, Binney said. They don’t want the American people to hear the truth either, he added.  “They’re hiding this. They keep the population ignorant, uninformed so they can manipulate them any way they want,” Binney said. “This is the same thing the mainstream media is doing.”Mainstream media outlets have branded the VIPS analysis as “disputed,” “fringe,” or a “conspiracy theory” (Washington Post, NBC, and CNN respectively) while failing to apply the same level of skepticism to the US intelligence community narrative.On Wednesday, the NSA whistleblower was repeatedly called Binney a “conspiracy theorist” in a CNN article about the meeting.“That’s basically showing the shallow weakness of their argument,” Binney said. “They produce no facts whatsoever and simply throw labels at people to do character assassination.”"
"Judging by the harsh accusation aimed at President Donald Trump by the Democrats, one would think they had the full backing of the people on their side. In reality, neither party sits very well with American voters.A whopping 54 percent of US citizens polled said they have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party, according to numbers from a CNN survey conducted by SSRS. The Democrats haven't fared that poorly since before Bill Clinton suffered impeachment charges over the 'Zippergate' affair involving the White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Political analysts had been predicting that such a reversal of fortunes was in the cards given the Democrats’ relentless pursuit of charges against Trump, whom they say colluded with the Russians to win the 2016 presidential election. The reality, however, is that many Americans simply aren't interested in what has come to be known as 'Russiagate.' Meanwhile, Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairwoman, just released a devastating new book that spares few members of the DNC. Brazile went so far as to accuse her colleagues of treating her ""like a slave,"" being sexist, and rigging the entire 2016 campaign in favor of Hillary Clinton.The Republican Party also got poor marks, with just 30 percent of Americans holding a favorable view, down from 42 percent in March. The poll found that six in 10 Americans, 61 percent, have an unfavorable opinion.However, there seemed to be some slight discrepancy in the tallying. SSRS noted that among the entire sample, 32 percent of those polled described themselves as Democrats and 24 percent as Republicans, which would seem to skew the overall sample in favor of Democrats.Significantly, 33 percent of liberals and 41 percent of conservatives hold unfavorable views of the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively. Additionally, four in 10 independents – 42 percent – say they have an unfavorable view of both parties. Just 8 percent of this segment has a favorable view of both.In any case, the two parties that receive a disproportionate amount of media attention, as well as ability to debate at a nationally televised venue, remain in the basement in terms of popularity as voters cast their ballots in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as dozens of local and mayoral races nationwide.Although the Democrats carried the day, to speak of the popularity of the Democratic Party based on an election seems about as accurate as measuring the overall financial position of the citizenry on Wall Street returns.So it should come as no surprise that many Americans – in fact, the majority of Americans – say year after year that what the country really needs is a political third way.In a September poll conducted by the reputable Gallup, 61 percent of Americans want to see a third party, which makes it the highest percentage Gallup has recorded on that question. Barely a third of those polled, 34 percent, think the Republican and Democratic parties are doing an adequate job.So what's stopping a third way from coming forward?"
