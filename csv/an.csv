"Hollywood stars jumps on Twitter recently to forecast the end of America after the Senate passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Saturday.Some celebrity reaction was loom and gloom, like comedian Chelsea Handler who called the passage of the GOP-led bill “sickening.”“What Republicans did last night to the poor and middle class in this country to reward huge corporations and the very wealthy is sickening,” she wrote. “So, for all the religious beliefs you hold, rewarding the people who fund your campaigns must be somewhere in the Bible.” What Republicans did last night to the poor and middle class in this country to reward huge corporations and the very wealthy is sickening. So, for all the religious beliefs you hold, rewarding the people who fund your campaigns must be somewhere in the Bible.— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) December 2, 2017 Actor Josh Gad called the bill’s passage “one of the most disgraceful acts in modern political history.” If you are not a billionaire, today should very well be marked as one of the most disgraceful acts in modern political history. Madness won— Josh Gad (@joshgad) December 2, 2017 The Senate reform bill, which passed on a party-line vote of 51-49, eliminates Obamacare’s individual mandate to purchase health insurance.More on the Senate bill from Breitbart News’ Sean Moran:The Senate bill retains the current income tax system’s seven brackets, while the House version collapses the seven brackets into four. The wealthiest Americans would have their income tax fall to 38.5 percent, while the lowest tax bracket will fall to ten percent. Similar to the House tax bill, the Senate version will double the standard deduction for individuals to $12,000, and $24,000 for married couples. The Senate bill also raises the child tax credit from $1,000 per child to $1,650.Michael Moore, a constant critic of President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers, said the Senate bill is akin to “fascism” and said, “the coup is underway” and said, “the Republican Party is the enemy of the American people.”These Hollywood stars have no idea what they are talking about, and only jump into the political scene when there is a popular opinion they should be sharing on social media, do we take anything they say on politics seriously? Or can we just disregard all of it?"
"Two New York lawmakers have threatened to force a shutdown in Congress in response to the DACA program that is shielding undocumented immigrants and protecting them from being deported.President Donald Trump is ending the current program and is giving Congress until March to find a replacement, as reported by WCBS 880’s Ethan Harp on Sunday night.Lisdy Contreras was born in Guatemala, and she came to the U.S. when she was a young girl as an illegal immigrant, she and thousands like her would be facing possible deportation if nothing replaces the current program.“I would never be ashamed to say I am undocumented and I’m currently a DACA recipient, because it has made me who I am,” Contreras said.She is also a former intern for U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York), who warns time is running out to save DACA.“This is matter of basic human dignity and a basic human right,” Gillibrand said.Gillibrand and her fellow Democrat, U.S. Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York), are now willing to risk a government shutdown. They are vowing to vote against any long-term spending bill that does not protect the 800,000 immigrants in this country called DREAMers from their supporters.“It has been these DREAMers that are here, and the work that they have done throughout the years, that have changed the public sentiment,” Espaillat said.Democrats have it backwards and believe that it’s a crazy idea to deport those who are here illegally just because they have been here for a long time. When you give people who have been in this country illegally free citizenship, it entices more and more illegal immigrants to come into this country illegally as opposed to through legal channels. It is a bad precedent to set for this country to award free citizenship to illegal immigrants. "
"It was a few weeks after the rains failed in the winter of 2009 that residents of Shirqat first noticed the strange bearded men. They would circle like vultures around the stalls of the town’s fertilizer market, looking for people to prey on, families they could get to accept what they had to offer.“Join us, and you’ll never have to worry about feeding your family,” Saleh Mohammed Al-Jabouri, a local tribal sheikh, remembers one recruiter saying.Every time the climate was a little too hot or a little too cold, enough to stress the farmers and their plants, the jihadists would reappear, throwing gifts into their offerings.When a particularly vicious drought struck in 2010, the fifth in seven years, they doled out food baskets. When fierce winds eviscerated hundreds of eggplant fields near Kirkuk in the spring of 2012, they distributed cash. As farming communities limped from one debilitating crisis to another, the recruiters—all members of what soon became the Islamic State—began to see a return on their investment.Two agricultural laborers in Azwai, a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it farming community just south of Shirqat, ran off to join the jihadists in December 2013. Seven more from outlying villages followed a month later. By the time the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) seized this swath of Iraq—along with most of the country’s west and north—in a brutal summer-long blitzkrieg in 2014, few locals were surprised to see dozens of former fertilizer market regulars among its ranks.“We said just wait until the next harvest, life will get better, life will become easier,” Jabouri said. “But things just weren’t getting better. There was always another disaster.”Life for these people in third world countries is ver difficult with radical terrorist groups breathing down your neck attempting to get you to join their cause, people like this need al the support they can get to avoid having to turn and join groups like this one."
"Time Magazine has released it’s finalist for it’s coveted “Person of the Year” award, including Trump there are 10 finalists, it is interesting to see who Time Magazine chose.The majority of the names on the list besides Trump have a weird connection, and it’s that they are all opponents of Trump in one way or another. They are either political adversaries, or they have publicly stated their dislike for Trump. At least six of the finalists on the list have gone on the record against the president for a diverse range of issues.Here is a truncated version:Colin Kaepernick: Former NFL football player who has openly stated how much he doesn’t like Trump as well as other conservative politicians.Dreamers: An entire class of million of illegal immigrants.Robert Muller: Head of the Investigation of Trump for collusion with Russia.Jeff Bezos: Owns The Washington Post, regular media target of Trump.Kim Jong Un: Wants to kill all Americans, and has emerged as one of the biggest threats to global and national security.Xi Jinping: President of China, regular Trump campaign punching bag.Patty Jenkins: Not very political, but a Hillary Clinton fan.The Magazine has been criticized by the President over it’s selection process. Earlier in November president Trump tweeted about being contacted by TIME for the issue, adding that he turned it down:“Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!”“The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6.”Lets all just hope Trump wins so we can get a good kick out of this looking back."
"The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral argument in the famed Masterpiece Cakeshop case, on Tuesday. The case is a seminal one for religious liberty because it pits the ability of local and state governments to enforce “anti-discrimination law” against religious practice rights for business owners; it essentially decides whether or not religious people can practice their religion in their business.The case revolves around a man named Jack Phillips, who works at a bakery. Jack has a rule that he will sell to anybody that walks through the door, gay, straight, black, white, as a Christian, he won’t however, make a cake for any event.This means that he sees it as sinful participation to make a custom cake celebrating a same-sex wedding. So he’ll make a cake for a same-sex wedding, but he won’t decorate it as such (no groom-groom wedding toppers, for example). He also refuses to make cakes that push anti-gay messages, anti-American messages, and adult-themed messages.This is Jack’s constitutional right, but apparently, liberals in Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission  don’t think so. They believe Jack has to go against his religion, and make cakes for any situation, or no situation. As a result of their ruling, Jack lost 40% of his business and more than half of his employees because he wants to do what was right by his religion.This is obviously fascistic stuff. But the LGBT advocacy Left believes that religious freedom is a true threat to LGBT rights — that we all have a right to one another’s services. Thus, Sarah Jones writes in New Republic:Why should the law obligate a calligrapher or a photographer or baker to take a specific order? But on closer review, the ADF’s argument breaks down. Wedding vendors don’t run ministries. They run businesses that are open to the public. And while business owners do have some legal flexibility over who they do or do not serve, this isn’t a matter of no shoes, no shirt, no service. The action Jack Phillips wants to take is morally equivalent to rejecting a customer because they’re blind or female or black. It doesn’t mean very much if Phillips allows a queer person to buy a birthday cake; the queer person has to hide any public evidence of his queerness in order to receive service. What Phillips wants is for the law to weight his personal beliefs about a person’s intrinsic identity above that person’s right to access a business.Nobody should be forced to do anything that contradicts their religion within reason. If Jack not wanting to make a gay couple a cake because of his religion bothers that many people, go to a different bakery. "
"Philadelphia councilwoman Cindy Bass is in the process of introducing a controversial bill, in which connivence stores in the city of Philadelphia would not be allowed to install bulletproof glass, as all of them currently have.The bill, known as the Stop and Go bill, is moving through city hall, and reads “No establishment shall erect or maintain a physical barrier.”Broad Deli is a local business on the corner of the 2200 block of North Broad. It has a wall of bulletproof glass separating its employees from customers which the owner, Rich Kim, claims is for the safety of his employees.“The most important thing is safety and the public’s safety,” Rich Kim, the owner of Broad Deli, told WTXF. His family has run the deli, which sells soda, snacks, meals, and beer by the can, for 20 years.Kim said that he had the bulletproof glass installed after a shooting, and that it saved his mother-in-law from a knife attack.“If the glass comes down, the crime rate will rise and there will be lots of dead bodies,” he said.Bass is more concerned with the customers feelings however and said they shouldn’t have to suffer the embarrassment of shopping through a bulletproof glass window.“Right now, the Plexiglas has to come down,” she said.Kim, the owner of the deli, disagrees with Bass, claiming that the bill targets Korean-Americans, who own these types of corner stores at high percentages.Choe, who runs a non-profit that supports Korean-owned businesses, said that he planned to raise $100,000 to fight the bill.“I do think it’s a bad bill that will endanger Korean Americans,” he said.It is an absolutely ridiculous and braindead idea to remove bulletproof glass from stores located in neighborhoods with high rates of crime. If these shoppers are worried about how they are going to “feel” shopping on the other side of the glass, the shop somewhere else, the glass is for safety, not for moral support."
"A new poll that ran over the weekend shows that most Republicans feel that democrats don’t stand for anything except for opposing the president. The poll’s finding were reported by Jon Karl of ABC news, he said:“Democrats stand for nothing more than opposing” Donald J. Trump. “That’s a problem for Democrats…they have to stand for something beyond simply opposing the president.”Jon Karl of ABC News announced the findings of a new poll this weekend. A majority of Americans think the Democrats don’t stand for anything except being against Trump.In the video below, Karl says:ABC News’ Jonathan Karl says new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows majority of the country believes that “Democrats stand for nothing more than opposing” Donald J. Trump. “That’s a problem for Democrats…they have to stand for something beyond simply opposing the president.” The New York Post has more on the Democrats’ lack of ideas:Why Democrats are still losing the war of ideasLast week, a Politico/Morning Consult poll on President Trump’s proposed travel ban on visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries revealed a somewhat surprising discovery: 60 percent of voters agreed with Trump’s proposed ban. That includes 56 percent of independents and even 41 percent of Democrats.The plan, however, has a distinct advantage: It’s the only idea on the table.What’s the alternative to the ban from the left? What’s the plan to stop terrorist attacks? Literally nothing.Every time there’s a deadly attack, liberals rush to downplay the dead bodies as just a regular part of life and not take any action lest we radicalize more terrorists. After the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, then-President Barack Obama said that we “refuse to be terrorized.” After the November 2015 terrorist attacks in France, the deadliest day of violence in France since World War II, Mayor Bill de Blasio said “terrorists can’t succeed if we refuse to be terrorized.”"
"The obsession that Democrats and the left have with disparate impact race politics is unhealthy and has crept its way into K-12 education. They continuously preach the importance of equality in education then use minority children as pawns in social experiments.Liberals are under the impression that in the classroom, you can reverse everything causing serious behavior problems at the home. They do this by attacking the disciplinary tactics of teachers and classrooms. Urban schools with predominately black or hispanic children face issues with discipline where minority students run into more disciplinary issues than white students, which puts the white children ahead more in the classroom. To the Liberals, this means that the classroom behavior rules are racist.They were making the claim that the rules were insensitive to different races and evidence of racism, a classic confusion of correlation and causation. School officials were even encouraged not to call the police for school altercations because it might be considered racist.Social engineers in colleges and universities began drawing up untested experiments using black and Hispanic kids as laboratory rats. They wanted to show that leaving disruptive kids in the classroom, instead of removing them for serious behavior violations including assaults on teachers, would improve scholastic performance.Instead of the desired results, the behavior, and the scholastic results both got worse. Leaving disruptive kids in a classroom is a danger not only to the teacher but to other students as well. The university professors are nowhere near the classrooms to see the disaster they created with their inane idea, nor are they held accountable.Not surprisingly, no amount of cultural sensitivity training of school officials will negate the culturally dysfunctional baggage brought to school every day by students. They spend more time at home than in the classroom and they bring what the learn from the home, to school, which isn’t always the greatest thing."
"On Tuesday, veteran Democratic fundraiser Matthew Lieberman was charged with multiple felony gun crimes after allegedly firing a handgun and shouting racial slurs at eyewitnesses at two businesses.Lieberman pointed a handgun at someone at the Amoco gas station on Skinker Boulevard and Highway 40 (Interstate 64) while engaging in hate speech and using multiple racial slurs, just after 11 p.m. Tuesday. according to court documents. He then allegedly fired multiple shots at the building from his car.Court documents revealed that surveillance cameras showed Lieberman holding the gun, and bullet casings recovered from the scene, match the weapon registered to Lieberman.Less than 15 minutes later, Lieberman was at the Jack in the Box on Hampton Avenue and it was a similar story, he was shouting racial slurs at the maintenance workers. He then fired a gun several times from a Mercedes sedan, the documents say.The owner of Grease Masters, John Remstedt, a company that cleans kitchen exhaust hoods, wrote a Facebook post saying his workers were attacked and shot at while working overnight at the Hampton Avenue restaurant on Tuesday.“My crew is fine, just a little shook up,” he wrote. He did not return requests for comment.Lieberman was arrested on Wednesday and is facing charges of unlawful use of a firearm and armed criminal action. One weapons charge includes a hate crime enhancement, with officers reporting that Lieberman’s “conduct and use of epithets indicate his actions to be motivated by race.” His bail is set at $250,000.Lieberman, a white man, heads two fundraising firms: Majority Strategies LLC, and RAL Strategic Investment Group LLC, and has been a major fundraiser for Democratic causes in Missouri.This is disgusting, and Lieberman deserves to spend some time behind bars for this, he could have easily hit and killed an innocent bystander and his language is unacceptable."
"In Trump’s short tie in office, his removal of Obama era policies and introduction of some of his own is being credited with jump starting what was a stagnant economy. But there’s one mountain of red tape that’s eluded his machete — the Obama-created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Until now.The White House finally gained control of the regulatory agency following the resignation of CFPB Director Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee and liberal Democrat who quit his special five-year post early to run for Ohio governor.Mick Mulvaney, a conservative budget director, was appointed to temporarily take over the powerful agency.On his first day on the job, Mulvaney instated a 30-day freeze on all new hiring and regulations at the CFPB, triggering a collective sigh of relief from the financial industry.“It is a completely unaccountable agency, and I think that’s wrong,” Mulvaney explained. “If the law allowed this place not to exist, I’d sit down with the president to try to make the case that other agencies can do this job well if not more effectively.”Already regulated by half a dozen other federal agencies, bankers have complained the new agency has too much power, is too partisan and has abused its regulatory authority over the past six years. Congressional Democrats established the CFPB in 2011 as part of the post-crisis financial overhaul.CFPB defenders such as former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, who drafted the bill creating the watchdog agency, have sought to rebut criticism by accusing Republicans of exaggerating complaints of overregulation.“In all the years since we created it, they do not give one single example of abuse. They talk about an agency that is ‘out of control,’ it’s a ‘bureaucratic monster.’ You would think there would be some horror stories. You would think they would say, ‘And here’s what they did wrong, it created this sort of problem,’ ” Frank said. “I hope people will ask these critics — what is an example of what they did wrong?”"
"Ty Cobb, President Trump’s attorney, downplayed the importance of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s guilty plea Friday.Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his phone calls in December 2016 with the Russian ambassador to America.Associated Press reported that the former Trump campaign and White House official admitted that “Trump transition officials directed his contacts with the Russians.”“The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,” Cobb said in a statement released to reporters. “Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel’s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.”Flynn is the fourth former Trump staffer who has been charged with something relating to communicating with the Russians during the 2016 Presidential election, but then again, Trump’s campaign team is the only one being investigated. I’m sure if you went down the list of people who worked on Hillary Clinton’s campaign, you will find quite a few of them that at the very least contacted Russians.Hillary Clinton sold them 20% of America’s uranium for god sakes, do we really think that in an election that was very close and heated to the bitter end, she couldn’t have turned to a foreign power that could possible offer some assistance?In the way that Donald Jr. met with the Russian lawyer in the hopes of obtaining damning information about Hillary Clinton, I find it hard to believe something similar didn’t happen on the Clinton side of things, the government just refuses to look into it as of now, but when the time comes, Clinton is in trouble."
"Rebecca Nagle, a prideful Cherokee Nation citizen and a self-described “two spirit (queer) woman,” wrote an interesting piece concerning the lineage of Elizabeth Warren. Warren has continuously lied about her Native American heritage throughout her life, and Trump has referenced it by calling her “Pochahontas” which she in turn has tried to turn into Trump being a racist and using a racial slur, but in reality, real Native Americans see through the games Warren is playing.After acknowledging the assumption that “as a young Cherokee woman” she would “take Warren’s side,” Nagle noted that merely standing up to Trump, whom she disagrees with also, doesn’t make Warren a hero.“She was not a hero to me when she failed to foster a haven of support for Native students within Harvard University’s alienating Ivy League culture,” Nagle writes. “She is not a hero for spending years awkwardly avoiding Native leaders. She is not a hero because, despite claiming to be the only Native woman in the U.S. Senate, she has done nothing to advance our rights.”“She is not from us. She does not represent us. She is not Cherokee.”Nagle outlined the root of the Warren / Native American controversy and how the then-Harvard Law School professor “categorized herself as ‘Native American’ during a time when the minority status served her career and later dropped the marker after gaining tenure.”Except, “…as Native people, we are relegated to being invisible, while Warren is not.”Nagle even drafted an apology letter for Warren to the Cherokee people:I am deeply sorry to the Native American people who have been greatly harmed by my misappropriation of Cherokee identity. I want to especially apologize to the over 350,000 citizens of Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the United Keetoowah Band. In my family, there is an oral history of being Cherokee, however, research on my genealogy going back over 150 years does not reveal a single Native ancestor. Like many Americans who grew up with family members claiming to be Cherokee, I now know that my family’s stories were based on myth rather than fact. I am not enrolled in any of the three Federally recognized Cherokee Tribes, nor am I an active member of any Cherokee or Native American community. Native Nations are not relics of the past, but active, contemporary, and distinct political groups who are still fighting for recognition and sovereignty within the United States. Those of us who claim false Native identity undermine this fight.I am sorry for the real damage that Native Americans have experienced as the debate about my false identity has revived the worst stereotypes and offensive racist remarks, all while Native people have been silenced. I will do my part as a Senator to push for the United States to fully recognize tribal nations’ inherent sovereignty and uphold our treaty obligations to Native Nations. I will use my national platform to advance the rights of Native Americans and I commit to building real relationships in Indian Country as an ally and supporter.Elizabeth Warren is so sad, shouldn’t she apologize for the way she has lied about her heritage to get into college, and stuck with it all this time?"
"A veteran FBI agent had to be removed from Special Council Robert Muller’s investigation as news came forward that the agent had sent some anti-Trump text messages to people in his contacts.Three seperate people close to the matter have confirmed that Muller reassigned Peter Strzok from the team investigating Russia’s election meddling to the FBI’s human resources department.Strzok is a veteran investigator who worked on the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was serving as Secretary of State under the Obama administration. Strzoks also was looking into potential connections between Trump and Russians during the 2016 presidential election.Strzok was removed from Mueller’s team after the Department of Justice’s inspector general launched an investigation into text messages Strzok has sent that could be portrayed as anti-Trump.The agent reportedly exchanged text messages with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, whom he was dating, during the campaign and Clinton investigation that appeared to support the Democratic presidential candidate, people with knowledge of the matter told The Washington Post.The Post could not reach Strzok or Page.“Immediately upon learning of the allegations, the Special Counsel’s Office removed Peter Strzok from the investigation,” Mueller spokesman Peter Carr told The Hill. “Lisa Page completed her brief detail and had returned to the FBI weeks before our office was aware of the allegations.”While it is a good sign that upon discovery of the agent with ant-Trump bias, that he was removed from the investigation, there is clearly an anti-Trump sentiment among these investigators that only serves to work against Trump.From Muller, to other members of his team, on a personal level they seem to not like Trump, whether it’s because he’s never been in politics and is able to win the presidency or it’s for another reason, it’s effecting the investigation for sure."
"Former President Barack Obama indirectly called out President Trump for his use of Twitter while talking to a leadership forum in India’s capitol of New Delhi.Obama made veiled jokes and threats about a number of Trump’s policies and practices drawing laughter from the audience at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, which was part of a three-country tour Obama is undertaking in one of his first global outings as a private citizen after leaving office.On the topic of social media, here is what Obama had to say:“Which my daughters think is odd. They were explaining to us how if you put a period at the end of a sentence it sounds harsh. I said, ‘No, that’s English. That’s how you know the thought is finished.'”He said he sees people getting in trouble for their tweets, and says they should follow the old advice of thinking before you speak: “Think before you tweet,” Obama said. “Same principle.”He said social media is a powerful tool, for both good and ill. “And look, I’ve got 100 million Twitter followers. I actually have more than other people who use it more often.”Here is what Obama had to say about leadership:“And so if you see a politician doing things that are questionable, one of the things as a citizen is to ask yourself ‘Am I encouraging, or supporting or giving license to the values I’m hearing out of the politician?'” Obama said. “Because frankly, politicians tend to be more of a mirror and more of a reflection of forces in the society.”What is Obama’s angle, going to another country and speaking in front of an audience and using that time to slam the current President? For what reason? One thing we can say, is that when Trump has a problem with somebody, he addresses them by name, he doesn’t beat around the bush."
"Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona used the word “insanity” to describe his Senate colleagues’ campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare this summer. McCain also reportedly told Trump he was “sorry” he couldn’t vote to repeal the god awful healthcare bill.Like most all senators, Trump called McCain to try to secure his vote for the bill, to which McCain responded by saying: “I thank you, Mr. President, for your involvement,” McCain told Trump minutes before he shot down the party’s last attempt to overhaul Obamacare. “I cannot vote for something called Skinny Repeal. I can’t do it. I didn’t even see the bill until today. I mean, this is insanity. I appreciate the call and now I have to go vote, and I’m sorry.”The “Skinny repeal” as it has been called, failed 51-49, with McCain, along with GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voting no, critical votes that went the other way.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn reportedly told reporters before the senate even voted on the bill that he thought it had no chance of passing. The skinny repeal was the republican senates last push to repeal Obamacare and it was more expected to be something to create conversation about the bill.Republicans have moved on to try to fix tax reform, as Obamacare is proving to be a difficult task to tackle given the pushback from Democrats, and likelihood of successfully passing a bill that repeals and replaces Obamacare in 2017 looks rather low.Congress should remain relatively busy the end of the year as Congress must deal with the budget in December along with a host of other legislative issues.Hopefully in the future, Trump and the DOJ can get something done without democrats protecting the god awful bills that were passed under the Obama administration. "
"Hillary Clinton spoke at a conference in Beijing and used her time in front of the microphone to talk about and bash, guess who.. President Trump, big surprise.Hillary is claiming that the United States and China should collectively weaken their stance on North Korea because it will inevitably cause conflict.Clinton was the keynote speaker at the Caijing Magazine’s three-day annual conference Tuesday. Clinton called on the presidents from China and the U.S. to avoid a “bluster” and void using “personal taunts” when dealing with Pyongyang, according to Bloomberg.She went on to criticize the Trump administration for ditching diplomacy and expressed hope that China wouldn’t do the same. While much of what Clinton was saying was directed at the U.S. policy towards North Korea, most of the jabs and insults were directed at the Chinese government and how they are going about the North Korea situation, claiming they, too, were taking the wrong approach to the situation and making things worse with their “secret” military buildups.“Beijing should remember that inaction is a choice as well,” Clinton said.I don’t know where Hillary Clinton is getting her information, but neither the United States or China have shut down diplomatic discussions with North Korea, it is just a lot more difficult to deal with an insane man who believes he is God than she thinks.Kim Jong Un is not a normal man or a normal leader, he has absolute power and is literally viewed by his people as being an immortal God. He also believes that the United States is his sworn enemy, and we are stopping North Korean expansion. Based on all this how easy do you really think it will be to sit down at a table with this man and get him to come to reasonable terms? "
"Yet another Democrat, this one on the House Committee on Natural Resources, has been accused of sexually harassing a female staffer and using taxpayer money to pay the woman off. Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva is being accused of being often drunk at work, and creating a hostile work environment.The secret deal with a former female staffer was revealed by The Washington Times on Monday. The payout was negotiated by the House Employment Counsel, the body’s attorney, and cost taxpayers $48,395.The settlement, however, may have violated House rules, The Times reported. It’s against House rules for a lawmaker to retain “an employee who does not perform duties for the offices of the employing authority commensurate with the compensation such employee receives.”Grijalva’s payout also should have been handed over in a lump sum, as opposed to monthly installments, according to the Times. The taxpayers had to foot the bill on a 5 month severance package for this woman, because another democrat couldn’t keep his hands off a co worker.“On the advice of House Employment Counsel, I provided a severance package to a former employee who resigned,” Grijalva told The Times in a statement.“The severance did not involve the Office of Compliance and at no time was any allegation of sexual harassment made, and no sexual harassment occurred,” Grijalva said.“Under the terms of the agreement, had there been an allegation of sexual harassment, the employee would have been free to report it,” he said. “Regrettably, for me to provide any further details on this matter would violate the agreement.”After just 3 months on the job, Grijalva made this young woman’s life at work so unbearable she needed to leave and threatened to sue. I find it very hard to believe that Grijalva did nothing wrong here, those democrats have a thing for the female staffers. "
"North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Un has successfully tested a nuclear missile that can reach basically anywhere in the world.The country recently ended a 10 week hiatus of their Nuclear program on Tuesday when it fired off a Hwasong-15 rocket – its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile yet.This poses a new problem for the Trump administration, who has vowed not to let North Korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the US mainland.After watching the launch, Kim Jong-un boasted about its success, according to state television presenter Ri Chun-Hee.‘Kim Jong-un declared with pride that now we have finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power,’ the presenter said.‘The great success in the test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-15 is a priceless victory won by the great and heroic people of the DPRK,’ she added, using the abbreviated name for North Korea.US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned on Tuesday that North Korea now has the ability to hit ‘everywhere in the world’ and that the latest missile test went ‘higher, frankly, than any previous shot they have taken.’The Pentagon has confirmed that the nuclear missile traveled a distance of 620 miles and landed within 200 nautical miles of Japan’s coast.President Trump vowed on Tuesday to ‘handle the situation’ in a brief interview with reporters, but gave no further details.‘A missile was launched a little while ago from North Korea. I will only tell you that we will take care of it,’ Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House a few hours after the missile streaked across Korean and Japanese skies at 745 miles per hour.Asked if Tuesday’s provocation by despot Kim Jong-un had changed his strategy in the region, he said: ‘Nothing changed. We have a very serious approach and nothing changed. We take it very seriously.’ "
"Surprise, surprise, Conyers has come out and publicly stated that he has no desire to resign in light of the recent allegations of sexual indiscretion from female coworkers. After referring to Conyers as an “icon” on “Meet the Press,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke to one of Conyer’s accusers, then issued a statement saying she believed the accusations and described them as “unacceptable and disappointing.”On Tuesday evening, a former spokesman for Conyers gave the public what might be the weakest defense of his former employer of all time. he is claiming that Conyers would often change inside his office, so staffers would sometimes walk in on him while he was changing. Maybe lock your door? Don’t change your clothes at work?

"Sen. john McCain will reportedly vote yes to the senate GOP Tax bill, greatly increasing it’s chances to pass. McCain was one of the last GOP senators who had not committed to supporting the proposal.“After careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill,” McCain said in a statement Thursday. “I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families.”With McCain’s vote, and a yes vote from Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, there aren’t many GOP senators left to decide. Republican leaders are tweaking the bill to ease concerns by other skeptical senators, including Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.; James Lankford, R-Okla.; Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Steve Daines, R-Mont.The fact that McCain has confirmed that he would vote for the bill comes with a little bit of surprise, as there has been some clear tension between Trump and McCain for a long time, and especially since McCain opposed the GOP healthcare bill.The senator also expressed his displeasure with the tax bill’s repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. The mandate requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Getting rid of the measure would lead to about 13 million more people uninsured, with average Obamacare premiums rising 10 percent, according to nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates.McCain called the individual mandate “an onerous tax that especially harms those from low-income brackets.”McCain and Trump have a pretty intense dislike for each other that is fairly well known so for McCain to pledge his support openly for the bill is a bit surprising, but welcome, as this is the type of support that Trump needs to accomplish what is on his agenda."
"It is getting ridiculous how much democrats are upset about the “Pochahontas” tweet, they are trying to use it as evidence now to further their Trump impeachment case due to “Abuse of Congress.” Abuse of Congress was used once before to try to remove a sitting president, one of the articles of impeachment against Andrew Johnson, one of only two presidents to be impeached, accused him of using “intemperate, inflammatory and scandalous harangues…and loud threats and bitter menaces…against Congress.”Trump was scolded by democrats in congress recently for referring to Elizabeth Warren, Sen. from Massachusetts, as “Pochahontas,” which he has done several times in the past in reference to Warren lying about her Native American bloodlines. Warren called the term “Pochahontas” a “racial slur” an claimed that it was offensive to Native Americans.While the tweet on its own would not be enough to qualify as a case for impeachment, said Allan Lichtman, a political historian at American University, it could potentially bolster an existing case against Trump, which is absolutely ridiculous.“That could be a part of an article of impeachment,” Lichtman, the author of a book on Trump titled The Case for Impeachment, told Newsweek Tuesday. “After all, you could couple that with his very intemperate attacks on the judiciary. Combine that with his attacks on the free press. You could couple all of that together and create a fairly powerful article of impeachment.”How sad is it when the President has to be worried about being removed from office for cyber bullying? A modern day descendent of Pochahontas remarked herself that the term should not be considered a racial slur, it’s an insult to the memory of an important historical figure, but the snowflake democrats are going to use any weak piece of evidence they have to further the impeachment case against Trump."
"The Trump-hating liberal media will find just about anything to be upset about, guess what it is this time? Christmas decorations. Apparently the gorgeous White House Christmas decorations that Melania Trump unveiled recently are “creepy” and reminiscent of “the shinning.” The decorations are up! @WhiteHouse is ready to celebrate! Wishing you a Merry Christmas & joyous holiday season! pic.twitter.com/d6ZuyeFvrw— Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) November 27, 2017 What’s not to like? According to HuffPost, the “Spooky White House Christmas Chamber Is Creeping Everyone The Heck Out.” “One chamber in particular is getting attention online for all the wrong reasons. It’s a twig-lined hallway that’s being compared to everything from ‘The Shining’ to ‘The Blair Witch Project,'” HuffPo wrote.The holidays are upon us!! Right now: flotus is seeing to every last detail here at the @WhiteHouse pic.twitter.com/TglHYDVUx1— Stephanie Grisham (@StephGrisham45) November 27, 2017 Speaking of overactive imaginations, “Melania Trump decks the halls with dead branches, spine-chilling wails of the damned,” according to the AV Club. “The holiday in question, in case you were checking your calendars, is Christmas, which in Melania Trump’s mind apparently conjures up the naked terror of running through a dark forest, alone, pursued by wraithlike shadows and the grasping claws of brittle, dead branches, the only sound the cackling of the ancient witch who will grant your wish to be rich and famous with a designer wardrobe and a gold-plated toilet… for a price,” they opined. Make Narnia Great Again @WhiteHouse pic.twitter.com/Q25k29nNdd— Mortons East (@MortonsEast) November 28, 2017 Elle magazine covered the story with a mocking tone: “The Theme for the White House Christmas Decorations Is Fear!” “This year, guests of the White House can have the perfect holiday experience of racing, screaming, through the halls of power before paying to leave. Nothing says Christmas like echoing cries of terror!” Elle complained.There people need to get a life if they have this much time to comment on the Christmas decorations in the White House.The Washington Post felt the need to slam “the odd assortment of books that make up the White House Christmas book tree.”The titles that make up President Trump’s holiday book tree are a perplexing assortment. “Holding Up the Earth” (2000) is a teen novel about five generations of women whose tales come together in a “story quilt.” “Sangoma” is a memoir of a former Eagle Scout from Illinois who moves to Swaziland to become a spiritual healer. “Developing Superior Work Teams” seems like a book the president might want to at least skim. “American Mourning,” an academic study of how public mourning shapes politics “and might be employed to shape our future outcomes,” seems an unusual choice, given the public mood."
"We have yet another example of how Hillary Clinton believes the world revolves around her, as she believes that Matt Lauer getting fired for his sexual misconduct is Karma for how he questioned her harshly about her private email server during the 2016 presidential campaign.On Thursday, Clinton was in Philadelphia promoting her campaign memoir, What Happened, when she was asked about Lauer being fired this week over allegationsof sexual misconduct.“Every day I believe more in karma,” Clinton said of Lauer.She went on to describe how “men who shaped the narrative” of her campaign hurt her at the time, but now they are all facing charges of sexual misconduct. She also repeated her past arguments about the election, primarily blaming a host of outside factors for her defeat.“She didn’t take a lot of the blame herself,” Philly Voice contributor Stephen Silver wrote of Clinton at the book event.“When it came to the forces that she felt contributed to the election result in 2016, Clinton checked off everything from Russian interference to the James Comey letter to an unfair news media to voter suppression efforts,” Silver added.An important note about Clinton’s speech was that it was attended by more than two-thirds women.“The only way we will get sexism out of politics is to get more women in politics,” she said.Silver noted about the gathering:At one point early in the evening, Clinton launched into an extended coughing fit, the kind of thing that tended to lead to theories during the campaign that the candidate was concealing some sort of illness. Weiner attempted to fill the time by making a self-deprecating joke about her own last name, but knowing that Clinton’s history with a man of that particular surname is what led to the notorious Comey Letter, she may have not found it so funny.Clinton is something of a divisive figure, and has been such for going on three decades. But with one exception, there was no divided reception Thursday night—among a theater full of people who paid hundreds of dollars to see the first female presidential nominee in Philadelphia one more time."
"Hillary Clinton is blaming an unlikely source for her election loss this time, another Democrat. Clinton is claiming former President Barack Obama is the reason why she couldn’t campaign on a platform of “change” as if it would have made any difference. Obama also actively campaigned for his former secretary of state throughout the election campaign.In an interview posted Wednesday with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Clinton bemoaned being seen as an extension of the Obama years.“It is true that when you run to succeed a two-term president of your own party, you have a historical headwind blowing against you,” Clinton told Hewitt. “It’s not just this campaign can be set apart from everything that’s ever happened in our politics. It is a challenge.”Clinton suggested her campaign suffered from mixed messaging.Not that she wanted to distance herself from Obama. “I was proud to serve in the Obama administration. I did not agree with everything that President Obama decided, but on balance, I really think he did what had to be done to rescue the economy, which as we all remember, was in desperate straits,” Clinton said.The former first lady also hinted at the fact that she isn’t done with life in politics or in the public eye. Getting into the spirit of Thanksgiving, Clinton was asked what she is thankful for in 2017.“I will be thankful for the opportunity to continue my service on behalf of the causes and values that are important to me,” she said.Despite her misgiving about messaging, Clinton says she continues to have a “high regard for the campaign that we put together, and all of the people who were working in it so hard.”"
"Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has made an absurd statement about the social climate under the Trump administration, claiming that it’s more acceptable to make a racist statement under the Trump administration than it was perviously. Hillary might be just coming out from under her rock, because at no point in history was the general public more PC, but see what she had to say:“I think there are people who are, unfortunately, kind of reverting back to rather virulent attitudes about race in part because I think that it’s become ‘politically acceptable,’ no longer politically correct to try to overcome our own feelings that often block us from seeing each other as fellow human beings,” Clinton said on the “Hugh Hewitt Show.”“I think there has proven to be more white supremacists and white nationalists than I wish there were in our country, as we saw tragically in Charlottesville and other places,” she continued.“And they have made common cause with the president’s agenda out of their own mouth that he is someone that they are counting on to promote it,” Clinton added.Hillary Clinton is sadly mistaken on so many fronts. Like I aid earlier, in 2017, everything is considered offensive, if anything there has been far less inflammatory, openly racist speech, and actions in this day and age, everything is just online in an instant, so it may seem like it’s happening more often.Just because the rally in Charlottesville for White Supremacists, doesn’t mean there are more white supremacists that exist, but just that it’s easier for them to get their message across online. In 2006, we didn’t have snapchat and Instagram video and we weren’t able to instantly connect with people. Now, if anybody sees a white supremacist rally in the park, they pul out snapchat and show their friends. "

"It has been less than a day since news broke of Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Bob Brady allegedly paying his primary opponent to drop out of the race, but CNN has published zero articles and devoted zero airtime to the story, surprising? not really, Brady is a democrat.The FBI was granted a search warrant for Brady’s campaign email, [email protected], as part of its investigation into payments Brady’s campaign allegedly made to 2012 primary opponent Jimmie Moore.Two of Brady’s political consultants during the campaign have already been charged in connection with the investigation.Searching CNN’s website will show you that in fact, no news outlet is covering this story that no doubt deserves to be covered, CNN is however covering Trumps twitter feud with Lavar Ball, the ridiculous basketball father of the arrested UCLA player.CNN refuses to cover real political news, and they turn around and point the finger at Trump claiming that him tweeting and his personal vendetta’s are ruining politics but they are the ones publicizing the things he tweets.CNN isn’t the only major network keeping its viewers in the dark about the Brady investigation. MSNBC also has yet to mention the story on-air since it broke.Fox News covered the story both online and in its on-air coverage.FBI special agent Jonathan R. Szeliga filed a search warrant request on November 1 in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for all emails associated with Brady’s campaign email.Maybe if Brady is actually convicted of a crime against all odds, we will see some news about the topic? Maybe democrats are using the same strategy they use with the sexual offenders they have in their party, just talk about how good of a person they are, or just don’t talk about it at all, and maybe the accusations will just go away. "
"Unsealed court documents regarding the lawsuit over Fusion GPS’s bank records have recently been unsealed by a federal judge on Tuesday, revealing new details of payments made last year to the opposition research firm that commissioned the infamous Trump dossier.The documents also shed new light on requests made by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about payments that Fusion GPS made to journalists.Richard Leon, a federal judge in the district court in Washington, D.C., was the judge who unsealed the documents. The documents list 112 transactions involving Fusion GPS. Most of the transactions were redacted, except for transactions between two law firms that worked on Russia-related projects last year.Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and DNC, paid Fusion a total of $1,024,408 between May 24, 2016 and Dec. 28, 2016, the records show.The largest payment was made just before the election. Perkins Coie made a $365,275 payment to Fusion GPS on Oct. 28, 2016, according to the records. The payment made in December was later than anybody previously thought had happened.The list of transactions leaves out what was paid to the former British intelligence official who wrote the Russian dossier, Christopher Steele. The firm reportedly paid Steele a total of $168,000 for his work, which lasted from June 2016 until the election.The records show that Fusion was also paid $523,651 by the law firm BakerHostetler between March 7, 2016 and Oct. 31, 2016.This is proof that the Russian Dossier was forged from the beginning and is rooted in no fact, but originated exclusively from the Democratic party and their desire to smear the name of Trump in an effort to elect Hillary Clinton.The committee also seeks records “related to Fusion’s payments to journalists who have reported on Russia issues relevant to its investigation.” Which could be another bomb shell just waiting to drop.   "
"Well this is weird, but the apparent leg injury that Senator John McCain has suffered, leaving him in a walking boot, has apparently and magically, switched feet.The Arizona Republican tweeted on Wednesday a photo of himself sitting next to his wife, Cindy McCain, attending their daughter’s wedding at their ranch in Arizona. Mother, father & puppy of the bride in beautiful Cornville #Arizona yesterday! pic.twitter.com/sd3rsye1OV— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) November 22, 2017 McCain has been wearing the boot since suffering from a minor tear in his right Achilles tendon earlier this month.

Bet that brain tumor is fake, too. #NotAHero pic.twitter.com/56lwi8bQ5H— Meme Chaos (@ExtinctMedia) November 23, 2017 On Thursday, Thanksgiving, McCain tweeted an explanation for the swap, saying that his left leg had been “doing extra work to compensate for the boot” so he had been “giving it a break.” Which makes no sense because to give that foot a break, you would need to be walking on your foot with a torn Achilles, I’m not a doctor, but that doesn’t seem like very sound medical advice.McCain who is now 81, was also diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, over the summer. McCains medical history is a little shaky and maybe now a little questionable. Nobody in there right minds at the age of 81 is taking a walking boot off their foot that has a torn Achilles, that is asking to re injure yourself, and again, I’m no doctor, but it seems incredibly painful to be walking on a foot with a torn Achilles."
"I know it’s a holiday weekend and most of us are taking time off to spend time with our families, but one man who’s not taking time off is Trump, who entertained us all this Thanksgiving by annoying the MSM yet again.Time media had quite the fit when Trump used their magazine cover for marketing purposes in some of his hotels so Trump having a laugh about it after the fact is funny to see.

"Susan Sarandon used to be a public enemy for those on the right side of the political spectrum. She publicly protested the Vietnam War, and and US aggression in Nicaragua and Iraq, making her no friends on the political right, but these days she’s become more of a friend to the conservatives, the tides have shifted and the left are the ones who couldn’t hate her more.She recently grabbed headlines for stating that had Hillary Clinton won the election, we would be at war right now. Probably not all that far off.Sarandon has always had an affinity for politics. She has an aura of resilience and looks indignant even at rest. She personally sees a lot of similarities between herself and Bette Davis. “We’re both east coast,” she says. “I didn’t consider myself a star; I was a character actor from the very beginning and not really sold as pretty, which is probably what’s allowed me to survive as long as I have. I have this broader phase.”Sarandon is operating well outside her golden years in terms of female Hollywood stars, but enjoys the roles “besides playing witches and bitches,” as she puts it.A few years ago, Sarandon herself said: “I think of myself as a humanist because I think it’s less alienating to people who think of feminism as being a load of strident bitches.”“And then suddenly it became OK to say feminist,” she says now. “That’s been very recent. There was a period when that wasn’t really happening. So now there’s been an opportunity to include men as allies. And I have to say, I remember going to the ERA [Equal Rights Amendment] march where there were 100,000 women and we were going around talking to senators for this vote and I got on the elevator, and the women were like: ‘We’re going to show them what the f**k we want.’ And I kept saying: ‘Calm down, that’s not the way we’re going to get things done.’”“It was counterproductive, clearly. But that image of the shrill woman became the definition of a feminist for a long time. And women had a right to be angry, and to feel empowered. But that was just one glimpse of a fairly emotional and strident definition, and there was a period when young women didn’t want that label.”And now? “It’s come back, and it’s gotten warped, especially with the election, where if you’re a woman you have to support Hillary Clinton.”Susan Sarandon gets it. You don’t make change by yelling louder and protesting harder, you need to make actual political change. Be the change that you want, if you want to be taken seriously, don’t take to the streets screeching, take to the courtroom and have a battle that matters."
"Late on Sunday night, President Trump and and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney were sued by an Obama-era official, in an attempt to secure control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), claiming she is the lawful interim successor to former CFPB Director Richard Cordray.Cordray just resigned last week and has prompted a crisis at the CFPB, which in time created a conflict over the power of the administrative state, and one that spans over multiple agencies.Basically what has happened since the Cordray resignation is that the law which charted the CFPB — the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act — contains a succession provision allowing the agency’s deputy director to assume the directorship if the post is vacant. Cordray designated Deputy Director Leandra English as his interim successor before resigning, citing that provision of federal law. The Trump administration countered that the president has power to name an acting director under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), and tapped Mulvaney to lead the agency until a permanent director is confirmed.The appointment of Mulvaney has prompted a law suit from English, who claims she is the rightful acting director.“The talented and hard-working CFPB staff stand up for consumers every day,” English said in a statement. “As acting director, I am filing this lawsuit to stand up for the CFPB.”English’s lawsuit argues the plain text of the Dodd-Frank Act dictates that she is the lawful acting director. The law provides that the deputy director shall “serve as acting director in the absence or unavailability of the director.”There is no absence of a director though, because one has been appointed by the President. According to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), this is something that Trump has the power to do, will the position with whomever he wants, as opposed to letting the man ho held the job before, chose his successor."
"Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democratic Senator who just narrowly escaped corruption charges after allegedly accepting free plane rides and vacations from a man in Florida, didn’t thank the U.S. Supreme Court when he finally addressed reporters on Thursday, don’t you think he owes them one considering they saved him from rotting in jail?The Senator was facing 18 charges of bribery, honest services fraud, conspiracy, traveling over state lines to carry out bribery, and making false statements on federally-mandated financial disclosures forms. The charges stem from his relationship with a political donor named Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida physician who lavished the senator with gifts, vacations, and campaign contributions.To repay the donor, Menendez was accused of intervening with federal agencies on Melgen’s behalf over several years, sure evidence, prosecutors claimed, that the pair had forged a “corrupt pact” to secure their mutual advancement.Menendez’s case is eerily similar to a case you might remember, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican whose conviction on federal corruption charges reached the Supreme Court in 2016. Like Menendez, McDonell accepted political gifts in exchange for unfair access to government agencies.A unanimous Court vacated McDonnell’s conviction, and in so doing, crippled the government’s power to bring criminal cases against corrupt politicians in the future.The problem with being able to pin charges down on these corrupt politicians is the definitely of an “official act” or what constitutes a favor exchanged between the parties basically.Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the Court gives the following definition of “official act”:“An ‘official act’ is a decision or action on a ‘question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.’ That question or matter must involve a formal exercise of governmental power, and must also be something specific and focused that is ‘pending’ or ‘may by law be brought’ before a public official.”It is too hard to prove “official acts” are happening, but they are, should this be changed?"
"With all the negative news recently, from Clinton’s Uranium One scandal, to the mountains of sexual accusations against politicians and the Hollywood elite, good news has been getting wept under the rug and forgotten about. Last week in Beijing, as part of his 12-day trip to Asia, President Trump announced that the US and China had signed an $83.7 billion memorandum of understanding to create a number of petrochemical projects in West Virginia over the next 20 years.A big deal for an area of the country that desperately needs it, and yet, speaking to the locals here, you wouldn’t even know it had happened.“I am surprised I heard nothing about it on the national news, nor in my local paper and newscasts,” said Jerald Stephens, 67, a West Virginia native and union rep, who has been a keen observer of local politics for as long as he can remember.“One would have suspected that the prospect of an investment this large — nearly three times the total annual budget for the department of energy — would have been front-page news,” said Paul Sracic, political-science professor at nearby Youngstown State University.Part of this lack of publicity is on Trump, who didn’t tweet about the deal despite tweeting about most everything. He did take a good shot at CNN though while in the Philippines: “While in the Philippines I was forced to watch @CNN, which I have not done in months, and again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is. Loser!”What really matters is despite the fact that the national media hasn’t grabbed the story, the people of West Virginia love the deal.“We really have no influence or power here, so that is interesting to me that he still kept his promise to us, something I suspect he will likely get little credit for in the national news,” said Stephens, who voted for Trump."
"While speaking at the Clinton Foundation even last Saturday, Hillary couldn’t help herself from taking a shot at Trump, are you surprised?While addressing the peace process that took place in Northern Ireland during Bill Clinton’s first term in office, Hillary Clinton had to say that Bill Clinton didn’t tweet about the challenges facing his presidency.“He didn’t tweet about it, he got to work about it and he actually got it done,” she said to applause from the audience. Twitter was founded in 2006.So what. Not only is Hillary uninformed because Twitter wasn’t around during her husbands presidency, but I personally think the fact that our president is so active on twitter and that the people can see his unfiltered thoughts makes people more interested in politics and makes the president more relatable. Can the president sometimes go overboard on Twitter with personal vendettas? yes, but that doesn’t change the fact that he often tweets about policy and political change and progress.The former first lady made the comment while speaking at an event commemorating the 25th anniversary of Bill’s victory in the 1992 presidential election.Interesting that while the women who have accused Trump of sexual indiscretions have reasserted their accusations in light of other political  figures being accused, likely for attention, Hillary didn’t bring that up, maybe because her husband is actually guilty of those crimes.Hillary is desperate still to get back at Trump for beating her in the 2016 election, she just can’t let it go and it’s really sad. It is upsetting to see that somebody has a personal vendetta so deep that their mission is to turn public sentiment away from the president rather than rallying public support for the president in an effort to better the country and serve the people. "
"The rouge regime that is North Korea has sentenced President Trump to death for his comments on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. Trump called the North Korean leader “short and fat,” the regime’s state media declared Wednesday and fired back in an unhinged diatribe blasting Trump as an “old lunatic, mean trickster and human reject.”The editorial published in Rodong Sinmun, the state’s ruling party newspaper, called Trump a “hideous criminal” for attempting to unite world leaders against Kim Jong Un and for the insult that he tweeted while on his five country Asia tour.“The worst crime for which [Trump] can never be pardoned is that he dared [to] malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership,” the editorial stated. “Trump, who is no more than an old slave of money, dared point an accusing finger at the sun.”It added: “[Trump] should know that he is just a hideous criminal sentenced to death by the Korean people.”The North Korea Newspapers also called Trump a “coward” for skipping his visit to the Demilitarized Zone. He was supposed to make a surprise stop but weather conditions forced them to skip the visit.“It wasn’t the weather. He was just too scared to face the glaring eyes of our troops,” the editorial stated.Trump ratcheted up the rhetoric Saturday by tweeting: “Why would Kim Jong Un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat’?”The tweet followed a well-received speech to an audience of South Korean lawmakers last Wednesday. Trump warned Kim Jong Un to not underestimate the U.S., at one point directly addressing the North Korean leader: “The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger.”“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he added. “The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation.” "
"Hillary Clinton has recently reversed her position on whether or not it is fair to question the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential election. I can’t say I’m surprised as Hillary will say just about anything these days to grab a headline and make sure people don’t forget about her, but this is just sad.“[T]here are lots of questions about its legitimacy,” Clinton said this week in an interview with Mother Jones, referring specifically to supposed voter suppression efforts and Russia’s meddling in U.S. politics.Russia “was one of the major contributors to the outcome,” she said, adding that Moscow used “weaponized false information [in] a very successful disinformation campaign [that] wasn’t just influencing voters, it was determining the outcome.”She added, “We don’t have a method for contesting that in our system. That’s why I’ve long advocated for an independent commission to get to the bottom of what happened.”It’s interesting because it was such a big point of emphasis for Hillary when Trump refused to state whether or not he would accept the election results, now the results have come out in Trumps favor, and Hillary is the one questioning the results.“I will look at it at the time,” Trump said during an Oct. 19 presidential debate. “I will keep you in suspense.”“That’s horrifying,” she replied. “Let’s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating — he is talking down our democracy. And I am appalled that someone who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that position.”“It’s funny, but it’s also really troubling,” Clinton said. “That is not the way our democracy works.”“We’ve been around 240 years. We’ve had free and fair elections and we’ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election,” she added.Hillary Clinton is just sad, I almost feel bad for her, can she just go away for a little while?"
"A top Democratic official just used taxpayer dollars to pay off a sexual harassment accuser. Michigan Rep. John Conyers a congressman, settled a wrongful dismissal complaint for more than $27,000 in taxpayer funding after he allegedly fired a female staffer because she wouldn’t “succumb to [his] sexual advances,” according to a new report.Conyers is apparently a serial sexual harasser who would prey on his female staffers in sworn affidavits signed by four of his former staffers.A different female employee filed a complaint in 2014, alleging that she was fired for rebuffing Conyers’ sexual advances. It was that employee who eventually received a $27,111.75 settlement in 2015, in exchange for a confidentiality agreement. As part of the settlement the congressman did not have to admit fault.“In her complaint, the former employee said Conyers repeatedly asked her for sexual favors and often asked her to join him in a hotel room. On one occasion, she alleges that Conyers asked her to work out of his room for the evening, but when she arrived the congressman started talking about his sexual desires,” BuzzFeed reported. “She alleged he then told her she needed to ‘touch it,’ in reference to his penis, or find him a woman who would meet his sexual demands.”Conyers would repeatedly make sexual advances on female staffers, “Rep. Conyers strongly postulated that the performing of personal service or favors would be looked upon favorably and lead to salary increases or promotions,” one former employee said in an affidavit.He also allegedly abused taxpayer funds to shuttle in women with whom he had sexual relationships.“One of my duties while working for Rep. Conyers was to keep a list of women that I assumed he was having affairs with and call them at his request and, if necessary, have them flown in using Congressional resources,” one affidavit states. Another staffer told BuzzFeed that Conyers, who is the longest-serving congressman, used taxpayer funds to fly women into see him.This is disgusting and a full scale investigation is needed to see the extent of his crimes."
"A Federal Judge from the state of California has blocked an executive order by Trump to reduce funding for sanctuary cities Monday, limiting the administration’s ability to punish municipalities that violate federal immigration law.The permanent injunction follows a preliminary ruling, issued in April, in a suit filed by the city of San Francisco and Santa Clara county.“The Counties have demonstrated that the Executive Order has caused and will cause them constitutional injuries by violating the separation of powers doctrine and depriving them of their Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights,” U.S. District Judge William Orrick for the Northern District of California wrote in his order.The DOJ tried to argue that the financial impact would be minimal on these municipalities, however, when appealed  to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after Orrick ruled against the administration.“The District Court exceeded its authority today when it barred the President from instructing his cabinet members to enforce existing law,” Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley said in a statement late Monday. “The Justice Department will vindicate the President’s lawful authority to direct the executive branch.”Orrick argued that statements made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump prove that this was intended for a large swatch of land and municipalities, resulting in a $2 billion loss in aid to these towns, according to the plaintiffs.At issue is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy of asking municipalities to detain suspected illegal immigrants for up to 48 hours so the individual can be picked up. Cities such as New York and Los Angeles are slowing the process by claiming to need arrest warrants for the suspects before detaining them.Why are these cities standing in the way of justice? they are forcing us to pay more for illegal immigrants when Trump is doing everything in his power to deport them."
"Want to know what top democratic lawmakers are doing with your taxpayer money? They are covering up for sexual harassment allegations against them. Longtime Michigan Congressman John Conyers has been accused by multiple female aids and coworkers of sexual harassment claiming that he would repeatedly make sexual advances towards the women and become upset when they would reject his advances.You know what’s worse than Conyers being a serial sexual abuser and also being one of the longest standing members of congress? The fact that he used taxpayer dollars to cover up for his sexual harassment issues.According to documents obtained by BuzzFeed, the women who accused Conyers of sexual harassment and who were paid off, were paid close to $28,000 and paid in a way that made it look like they were under salary so that taxpayer money could be used.Of course Conyers denies all allegations: “My office resolved the allegations — with an express denial of liability — in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation. That should not be lost in the narrative.”The Buzzfeed article reads: “After the revocation period identified in paragraph 17 expires (and assuming that Complainant does not revoke this agreement) and after the Executive Director approves this agreement in puruant to prargraph 18, the Office agrees to rehire Complainant as a temporary employee for a period of three months (“the severance period”). During the severance period, the Complainant will receive gross pay of $9,037.25 per month or a total gross pay during the severance of $27,111.75 less applicable without holdings and deductions.”The woman was disguised as a temporary employee so she could be eligible to receive a pay out from Coyners in exchange for her silence about the sexual harassment. Coyners is a snake and he’s not good for the taxpayers, get him out of office."
"Hillary Clinton just can’t seem to get over her loss in the 2016 presidential race to Trump, because she has been incessantly been questioning the results of the election ever since it’s conclusion in November.“Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time,” Trump tweeted. “She just can’t stop, which is so good for the Republican Party. Hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years!”“I think it was one of the major contributors to the outcome,” she said. “Propaganda works. Advertising works. It’s a form of propaganda. So the Russians may have started out a little heavy-handed and clumsy about it, but they were clearly getting guided as to where to target a lot of their fraudulent claims and phony news.”Hillary Clinton is doing everything in her power to detract from Trumps administration. Even in defeat she just wont go away, she has to constantly answer interview questions dragging up the past in an effort to draw public attention away from the positive political reform that Trump wants to accomplish.She has yet to accept the fact that the public has deemed that Trump is a better presidential candidate than her. Trump won, you can do all the recounting you want, the fact is more people wanted to see Trump in office than another Clinton."
"White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has been receiving sexual misconduct questions quite a bit recently as you can imagine. About Trump, about Roy Moore, about everyone, I can imagine she is a little annoyed having to continue talking about it.Sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama senate candidate Roy Moore and Minnesota Senator Al Franken have reignited the past harassment allegations against numerous politicians, including President Trump. Trump has been accused multiple times of sexual misconduct but has not been convicted of anything, which is receiving more attention now as other prominent political figures such as Al Franken are being faced with allegations of sexual misconduct.The president has adamantly denied any wrong doing. During Friday’s briefing, Sanders was asked about Hillary Clinton, Trump 2016 presidential adversary. Clinton ominously said in a recent interview that she “worries” about Trump’s behavior from his past “because it tells you how he behaves in the present and will in the future.”When a reporter asked Sanders to comment on Hillary’s critique of the president’s alleged sexual behavior Sanders shut down the question cold, saying:"
"As you might have already read, the GOP-lead house of representatives passed  tax reform bill earlier this week with relative ease. Not one Democrat supported the measure which non partisan political commentators have stated would benefit the middle class.Of the thirteen Republicans who voted no, most of them come from high income blue states. The bill partially eliminates the federal deduction for state and local taxes, which disproportionately benefits those who live in places like New York and California, it gives them protection from electing the tax-and-spend liberals.While certain elements of the bill are still being debated, the bill offers across the board tax cuts and a long awaited simplification to the tax code to help your average American understand what they are paying in taxes and why.Brackets have been consolidated, income tax rates are slashed for nearly all levels of taxpayers (excluding millionaires), and the tax code is made more competitive for many small businesses and corporations.  Independent analyses have found that the proposal would (a) result in net tax reduction for average taxpayers and households across all five income groups, including middle-income families, (b) create nearly one millionnew, full-time American jobs, and (c) boost US economic growth.  The average household of four people, based on national median income, would save nearly $1,200 on their tax bill next year.  Democrats are predictably denouncing the plan as “tax giveaways to the rich,” which is what they always, say no matter what (reminder: “the rich” pay more than their fair share of taxes already), but the data tells a different story: Chart based on Tax Foundation's nonpartisan analysis of House GOP's reform bill shows after-tax income would rise across *all* income groups, on average. As a % of income, lower & middle income earners benefit more than the very rich: pic.twitter.com/Jfw5Yy6EHq— Guy Benson (@guypbenson) November 16, 2017 This bill is a positive for almost anybody involved, despite liberal assertions that it doesn’t help the middle class as much as advertised they admitted that, “the legislation would reduce taxes on average for all income groups in 2018 and 2027.”"
"According to Hillary Clinton, assigning a special council to investigate her for her involvement in the Uranium One deal would be a waste of everybody’s time and effort.. right.Clinton went as far as to say that if she were investigated, it would feel like America has become an “authoritarian regime,” and she believes it would be “demoralizing” to the people and the government. Quite the opposite Hillary, most of us can’t wait to see you go on trail for something.Clinton told Mother Jones on Wednesday:If they send a signal that we’re going to be like some dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime, where political opponents are going to be unfairly, fraudulently investigated, that rips at the fabric of the contract we have, that we can trust our justice system … It will be incredibly demoralizing to people who have served at the Justice Department, under both Republicans and Democrats, because they know better. But it will also send a terrible signal to our country and the world that somehow we are giving up on the kind of values that we used to live by and we used to promote worldwide.So it would set a bad example to start a which hunt that attempts to implicate somebody for colluding with Russia? Like the one that was started with president Trump based off your instance that he was in fact colluding with Russia when he is in fact not?There is an absurd double standard when it comes to Hillary Clinton in the media and in the eyes of the law and the American people are sick of it. People haven’t trusted Hillary for years but that doesn’t stop the media from protecting her and her friends in Washington from doing the same, it’s time to investigate Hillary Clinton."
"Former Chief Strategist to president Donald Trump, Steve Bannon is keeping his options open in terms of possibly ditching his support of Roy Moore as more and more sexual assault allegations continue to pile up against the Alabama state senate candidate.The Brietbart Chairman has publicly stood by the candidate, who is now accused of attempted rape of a 16-year-old girl. Bannon has also lead the charge against what he considers “fake news,” and the GOP establishment for trying to push Moore out of the race.“This is just another desperate attempt by Mitch McConnell to keep power, and it’s not going to work,” Bannon said on Monday’s episode of Breitbart News Daily. “You know, people in Alabama see through this. The good folks of Alabama are going to be able to weigh and measure this… This is an orchestrated hit from the Uniparty.”Bannon has expressed to friends and colleagues that he is admitted uncomfortable with the charges of sexual indiscretion against children being brought against Moore, but he wasn’t convinced that the initial flood of on-record testimony, starting with the first Washington Post story last week, was anything more than an attempt to discredit Moore, which he believes may have been planted by #NeverTrump operatives to put the screws to Moore’s campaign.Reports indicate that Bannon’s most trusted allies are telling him that it’s ridiculous to believe that all of these accusations are baseless and it’s in his best interest to distance himself from Moore before it’s clear that it’s due more public pressure more so than Bannon’s own conscious.If Bannon wants to stay in the good graces of the public he needs to let go of Moore and let him go down solo, Moore is clearly in need of help and has done some very very questionable things he needs to answer for."
"Five articles of impeachment were recently delivered to President Trump from House Democrats, stating that their “great concern” for our country lead them to deliver the impeachment, Reps. Steve Cohen (D., Tenn.), Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.), Al Green (D., Texas), and Adriano Espaillat (D., N.Y.) spoke at a press conference outlining their support for a move that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has publicly opposed.“[We’ve] taken this action because of great concern for the country and our Constitution, our national security, and our democracy. We believe that President Trump has violated the Constitution, and we’ve introduced five articles of impeachment,” said Cohen, who went on to outline them.The articles all have varying accusations against the President, the first article claims he unlawfully fired James Comey in May,the others allege various violations of the Emoluments Clause, undermining the judiciary, and undermining freedom of the press.Cohen said Trump has shown a “pattern of behavior” that belittles institutions important to American democracy.[email protected]: “We believe that President Trump has violated the Constitution, and we’ve introduced five articles of impeachment.” pic.twitter.com/nC7bdnhYqR— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 15, 2017From Cohen’s twitter page. “We’re calling upon the House to begin impeachment hearings immediately,” Cohen said. Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens called impeachment efforts a “radical effort” that most Americans do not support.“House Democrats lack a positive message and are completely unwilling to work across the aisle, so instead they’ve decided to support a baseless radical effort that the vast majority of Americans disagree with. Republicans are focused on issues the middle class actually cares about, like cutting taxes and growing the economy,” Ahrens said. Just anther sad, desperate attempt to get a man out of office because you don’t like him personally. The Presidency isn’t about making friends as Trump has shown, but he is getting things done. "
"Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) used his allotted time during a House Judiciary Oversight Hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday to read out some of President Trump’s tweets about “Crooked” Hillary Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren (D-MA).Conyers read out the following tweets, while a large television screen displayed them in the hearing room on Capitol Hill:"
"Nine days into his ten day European journey, Jerry Brown had an interesting answer to a very simple question. The Democratic Governor had just finished up interviews with news stations from Japan and Germany, when he was asked if he has bee enjoying his European trip, to which he responded:“No, I hate everything,” he said, allowing the slightest smile. “Why do you ask that silly question?”“I mean it earnestly” the reporter responded.Brown then responded that at his old age of 79, if he didn’t enjoy it, would he still be running around Europe, to which the interviewer responded “maybe.”“Why, because I’m a masochist?” Brown asked.“There are certain things you have to do that aren’t as pleasant as other things you have to do, but if it’s something you want to get accomplished, you will do it, and there will be different levels of joy, from zero to 100 percent,” he said.Brown then inquired if there were any more serious questions to be asked, and that he was not interested if the reporters enjoyed their jobs.“I’m interested in that you do a good job, or that you are being productive.”“Joy,” Brown added, fixating on the word. “See, I don’t even conceptualize the world that way … Some people say, ‘I had a great dinner last night.’ You know that story? Or, ‘Are you having a good time? Did you have a good buying experience?’“I just don’t even think that way. I like virtually every meal I eat and every drink I take,” Brown said, turning to an aide. “So, I’m having a good time. Right?”"
"Does anybody need another reason to dislike the Clinton crime family? As if they weren’t already the mot unlikeable couple in politics, Bill Clinton has made the ridiculous claim that in flux of Muslims into America has “deeply enriched” our country.I would love to hear just one example of how our country has been “enriched.”It must be the influx of popular islamic arts and music that have been amazingly popular, or their beautiful language that has really caught the minds of the American people, or how about their religion that preaches intolerance? All beautiful aspects of their culture that are totally “enriching” America right?Well not really. As beautiful as their culture might be, it’s not really a big hit over here in America. Muslims have been coming over to America to experience our culture, we have gained little from theirs.In their home countries, there is persecution against women, religious differences, provocative art and music, how is it that droves of Muslims from such a restrictive and rigid culture, are coming to America to experience our culture based off freedom of expression, and we can make the claim that they are “enriching” our country and our culture, as if we needed an infusion of intolerance into our society.Maybe we should start taking some pages out of the Muslim societal book, since the have so much to offer. Why don’t we start dressing up our women in all black from head to toe? We should also start taking our children out of schools with formal education and instead subject them to a radical, religious education that isn’t useful.I wonder what Bill Clinton has in mind when the word “enriched” came out of his mouth, what aspect of our country or culture is better off with a massive influx of Muslims? "
"The coverups for Hillary Clinton continue as a federal judge threw out a lawsuit that would have forced the FBI to do more to try to recover the email that Hillary Clinton destroyed, ruling that they have done everything they could to recover the emails.Two watchdog groups, Judicial Watch and Cause of Action, had sued in 2015 demanding the government recover all of Mrs. Clinton’s emails, saying she violated open-records laws by not preserving her messages.U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, though, said the FBI did what it could, and did manage to recover thousands of messages Mrs. Clinton didn’t return herself.Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said he had expected a better effort out of the Trump administration in tracking down Mrs. Clinton’s emails.“I think the president, once he learns about this, is going to blow his top and he ought to,” Mr. Fitton said.John Vecchione, president of Cause of Action, said this does not prove that all of Mrs. Clinton’s “unlawfully removed email records” were recovered.“Unfortunately, the court concluded that efforts by the FBI in its investigation of Secretary Clinton’s handling of classified material, which resulted in the recovery of numerous emails that Clinton had not previously turned over, left nothing further for the attorney general to do,” he said."
"Trump’s longtime body guard testified in front of congress this week and reportedly he said that Trump was offered as many as five Russian women in 2013 but immediately declined the offer.Keith Schiller also confirmed that after a meeting reguarding a Miss Universe Pageant, a Russian offered to “send five women” to Trump hotel suit in Moscow.NBC News reported: Two of the sources said the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, viewed the offer as a joke, and immediately responded, “We don’t do that type of stuff.”The two sources said Schiller’s comments came in the context of him adamantly disputing the allegations made in the Trump dossier, written by a former British intelligence operative, which describes Trump having an encounter with prostitutes at the hotel during the pageant. Schiller he described his reaction to that story as being, “Oh my God, that’s bull—-,” two sources said.Well what do you know, a fake story came out about Trump and then the facts came out to refute the fake story.This is a classic case of a media outlet such as CNN hearing a rumor about Trump and reporting on it before they know all the details. I’m sure they heard from a source, a story about Trump and five Russian women where they assumed that because it was offered, Trump accepted, but eyewitness accounts have refuted the story.This story has been haunting Trump since his inauguration when the news of this being a possibility came out. He was absolutely crushed on CNN and other liberal news outlets who treated these rumors as fact.I’m glad we have clarity on the issue now, and I’m just wondering, which one of Trump rumors will be the next one to be debunked? because they seem to be falling like dominoes."
"Donna Brazille is publishing a book detailing what she calls turmoil in the democratic party during the 2016 election and Hillary Clinton campaign. A main point she touches on as to why Hillary’s campaign was doomed from the start is the fact that Hillary Clinton’s health is not great, and had she won, she might have had to have been replaced mid-term.So what? She didn’t win, why does this matter? it’s important because it details the bias that exists in mainstream media. Trump made public the fact that Hillary Clinton had poor health and people were under the assumption that it was just an attack against Clinton, but now a member of her own party makes the same claims, and it makes headlines of major news outlets.The fact that no news media outlet was willing to report on Hillary Clinton’s health is less a problem of sloppy reporting and more of a problem of that major media outlets do less coverage of Hillary Clinton and more covering up of Hillary Clinton.Ask yourself this: how is it possible that major democratic leaders were having conversations about replacing Hillary Clinton mid election due to health reasons, and none of the thousands of reporters who were responsible for election coverage reported on it?The answer is that if the media is impartial, it’s not possible. The narrative of the media for the entire election was, make Hillary win and Trump lose, so any information about Trump that was unflattering made headlines, while anything Hillary was involved in, including the Uranium One deal and the Russian dossier, was swept under the rug.The bias that exists in the media is very apparent and very unfair. Hillary Clinton has been receiving privileged citizen status for way too long, it’s time to see her for what she really is."
"The ties between Hillary Clinton and Harvey Weinstein are become more and more apparent by the day. News has broke that a top donator to the Hillary Clinton campaign used an “army of spies” to intimidate women accusing Weinstein.Read these excerpts and tell us what you think:A top Democratic lawyer and major donor to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama helped Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein organize an “army of spies” to suppress sexual assault accusations, according to a new report in the New Yorker.David Boies acted as a go-between for Weinstein — who has his own ties to both Clinton and Obama — and the investigative firms that Boies hired to suppress sexual assault accusations, Ronan Farrow reported in the explosive piece.Boies “personally signed” a contract ordering investigative firm Black Cube — described as “an enterprise run largely by former officers of Mossad and other Israeli intelligence agencies” — to suppress a New York Times report on sexual assault accusations against Weinstein, according to Farrow’s report.Boies is often described as a “Democratic superlawyer.” He represented former Vice President Al Gore in his legal challenges to the 2000 presidential election results. In 2014, he earned a profile in Vanity Fair by leading the legal charge to overturn California’s Prop. 8, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. In 2015, Fortune Magazine described him as “the most famous trial lawyer in the country.”Boies is a major Democratic donor. He personally donated $1 million to a super PAC supporting former President Barack Obama’s re-election in 2012. He hosteda swanky fundraiser for Hillary Clinton at his New York home in September 2016, right in the heat of the campaign.Six weeks after Boies hosted the Clinton fundraiser, according to the New Yorker’s report, his law firm wired $100,000 to Black Cube for the muckraking operation on Weinstein’s alleged victims. The investigative firm reportedly billed the firm $600,000 for the work.Two private investigators from Black Cube, using false identities, met with the actress Rose McGowan, who eventually publicly accused Weinstein of rape, to extract information from her. One of the investigators pretended to be a women’s-rights advocate and secretly recorded at least four meetings with McGowan. The same operative, using a different false identity and implying that she had an allegation against Weinstein, met twice with a journalist to find out which women were talking to the press. In other cases, journalists directed by Weinstein or the private investigators interviewed women and reported back the details.The explicit goal of the investigations, laid out in one contract with Black Cube, signed in July, was to stop the publication of the abuse allegations against Weinstein that eventually emerged in the New York Times and The New Yorker. Over the course of a year, Weinstein had the agencies “target,” or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories. Weinstein monitored the progress of the investigations personally. He also enlisted former employees from his film enterprises to join in the effort, collecting names and placing calls that, according to some sources who received them, felt intimidating.In some cases, the investigative effort was run through Weinstein’s lawyers, including David Boies, a celebrated attorney who represented Al Gore in the 2000 Presidential-election dispute and argued for marriage equality before the U.S. Supreme Court. Boies personally signed the contract directing Black Cube to attempt to uncover information that would stop the publication of a Timesstory about Weinstein’s abuses, while his firm was also representing the Times, including in a libel case.Boies confirmed that his firm contracted with and paid two of the agencies and that investigators from one of them sent him reports, which were then passed on to Weinstein. He said that he did not select the firms or direct the investigators’ work. He also denied that the work regarding the Times story represented a conflict of interest. Boies said that his firm’s involvement with the investigators was a mistake. “We should not have been contracting with and paying investigators that we did not select and direct,” he told me. “At the time, it seemed a reasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thought through, and that was my mistake. It was a mistake at the time.”"
"Despite the outcries of Democrats, liberals and anti-gun fanatics alike, no amount of increased vetting for individuals trying to purchase firearms would have resulted in Devin Kelley, the Sunderland, Texas shooter, not being able to purchase one.A a press conference in South Korea on Tuesday, Trump was asked if he would seek “extreme vetting,” similar to the plan he has advocated for individuals entering the U.S. from other countries. Trump responded by stating that increased vetting wouldn’t have prevented the Sunderland, Texas shooter from buying a firearm. Not only that, but it could have possibly prevented the man who confronted him with a gun, from buying his.“If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago, and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him, and hit him and neutralize him,” Trump said. “And I can only say this: If he didn’t have a [gun], instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead. So that’s the way I feel about it. Not going to help.”The shooter had three guns that he himself purchased, a military grade assault rifle, and two handguns. Kelley had been discharged from the Air Force after an assault charge in which he assaulted his girlfriend and son, which should have barred him from purchasing the firearms, but failure on the side of the Air Force to correctly enter his convictions into a database.Trump did not want to initially answer the question, telling the reporter that is was inappropriate, but he responded none the less.“Well, you’re bringing up a situation that probably shouldn’t be discussed too much right now. We could let a little time go by, but it’s OK,” Trump said. “If you feel that that’s an appropriate question, even though we’re in the heart of South Korea, I will certainly answer your question.” "
"U.S. president Donald Trump reiterated the tough rhetoric he has been preaching against North Korea on Sunday in Japan. He stated that the U.S. and it’s allies are dedicated to preserving freedom, and that no dictator should underestimate the resolve of the U.S.Trump is just kicking off a 12 day Asia trip in which he will be attempting to present a united front with Japan against North Korea. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump will be discussing Nuclear testing by North Korea in the region as well as other related topics.Trump mentioned to reported en route to Asia while on Air Force One that discussions would be centered around North Korea and also trade, which he added had been “badly handled” for years in the region.Trump has ruffled the feathers of some of his allies with provocative talk of how he will “totally destroy” North Korea if it directly threatens the U.S. and his dismissive language towards Kim Jong Un, calling him a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.A top Trump aid said that Trumps main message to Asian leaders is that time is running out to deal with the situation on the Korean Peninsula.As soon as Trump landed in Japan, he addressed thousands of camouflaged U.S. and Japanese troops at Yokota Air Base, just west of Tokyo, and talked about how dangerous it would be for North Korea to underestimate the U.S.“Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?” said Trump, who wore a bomber jacket as he addressed the troops.“We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defense of our freedom,” Trump said.This is what Trump was elected for, strong leadership in the face of adversity, if he made one thing clear in his trip to Asia thus far, it’s not to take the U.S. lightly. "
"Yesterday, November 4th was the say of reckoning for Antifa, a radical liberal group that is looking to overthrow the Trump administration. The day was a massive let down for the group and very small numbers gathered around the country to do whatever it is they were going to do on this day of “civil war” as they called it. A bus of three people showed up to the white house the Maryland… three.The only notable event that happened during the day of “civil war” is actually going to be a negative for the group, as one of their members attacked Rand Paul. Paul is a Republican Senator from Kentucky. The Senator was attacked in his home, with his family home, not many details of the attack are known, but Paul suffered minor injuries and is going to be ok.Weirdly, this is being ignored by the media, A Senator was attacked by a political extremist in his own home, and nobody is talking about it with the severity that they should. Is it because the movement is liberal? or is it because Paul didn’t suffer much in terms of injury?This is so sad, a radical political group that couldn’t even organize a rally, had one of it’s members attack a United States senator, because they couldn’t get the traction that they desired.This group, Antifa, is clearly inciting people to be radical, and they should be shut down following this horrific attack on Rand Paul.There is no room in the American political system for those seeking to to physical harm to it’s political opponents. Despite the fact that Liberals and Conservatives disagree, at the end of the day we are on the same side, and seeing one side attempt to enact such violence on a leader from the other side is disheartening, America is better than that."
"Now that Robert Muller is head of the special council responsible for investigating if there was any collusion between president Trump and Russia during the 2016 presidential election, I think it’s time to take a look back at his collaboration with radical islamic groups while he was head of the FBI and maybe re think his position as head of the special council.Judicial Watch obtained droves of documents in 2013 detailing how, under the direction of Muller, the FBI got rid of all anti-terrorist training material deemed “offensive” to Muslims, after secretly meeting and discussing it with radical islamic organizations. Judicial Watch had to sue to get the records and published an in-depth report on the scandal in 2013 and a lengthier, updated follow-up in 2015.Muller did everything in his power to appeal these islamic groups, and in the process, deleted tons of potentially useful documentation for anti-terrorism. Among the groups that Muller met with were two organizations— Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), specifically named by the U.S. government as unindicted co-conspirators in the 2007 Holy Land Foundation terrorist financing case.According to the records obtained by Judicial Watch, Muller, who served as the head of the FBI for 12 years, met with the islamic groups on February 2, 2012, listened to their demands and assured islamic leaders that he removed what they considered damaging to the image of Islam, from the anti-terrorist curriculum.Here are some of the reasons provided by Mueller’s FBI for getting rid of “offensive” training documents: “Article is highly inflammatory and inaccurately argues the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization.”Also purged from official documentation: An article claiming Al Qaeda is “clearly linked” to the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing; The Qur’an is not the teachings of the Prophet, but the revealed word of God; Sweeping generality of ‘Those who fit the terrorist profile best (for the present at least) are young male immigrants of Middle Eastern appearance;’ conflating Islamic Militancy with terrorism. The list goes on and on."
"In a new bill being proposed by Republicans meant to cut tax breaks, one of the targets of the bill, is the NFL. While the code also accomplishes other tasks, such as preventing house “flippers” from being tax exempt, and requiring Universities to pay taxes on endowments, a main target is the NFL.Politicians have been vocally opposed to the anthem protests taking place in the NFL right now, and the NFL ownership has proven to be unable to stop the protests, which are killing their business, so lawmakers had to step in.Americans all over the country and offended and disgusted by the NFL players using their platform at their place of work, to protest police brutality. They have been boycotting the NFL in all forms, the ratings are down, and the NFL owners are losing money.The reason nothing has been done is that the NFL is a gaggle of 32 owners who are held together by a weak, ineffective leader in Roger Goodell, who can’t make decisions to save their lives, or the lives of their businesses.NFL football is a sport and league people strongly associate with America, from the fact that it’s only played here in America, and the meritocracy of the game, and the brotherhood represented on the field. Football represents America, and to see the players disrespect everything the game, and the flag stands for is enough to make your average American not watch.This bill should shake some sense into the owners, that if they don’t get their acts together, and figure out a way to prevent players from protesting, the government can make their lives a lot harder, and more expensive, and while everything is getting more expensive for the league, they are losing viewers, not a good place to be if you are the NFL."
"The former head of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, forgot to alert the democratic national committee’s officers about a breach of their servers despite knowing about the incident for over a month, according to then-DNC officer Donna Brazile.Wasserman Shultz only came forward with the information about the breach when she found out that The Washington Post was about to break the story. The DNC then commissioned Perkins and Coie, the same law firm tied up in the Hillary Clinton – Uranium One deal, to make major decisions, like how to handle the breach of the servers that lead to a very embarrassing email dump.The timing suggests the DNC’s unusual and significant choice to have the private law firm CrowdStrike conduct the investigation into the breach, rather than turn the evidence over to law enforcement, was made without consulting DNC officers.“She told [officers] about the hacking only minutes before the Washington Post broke the news,” Brazile wrote.A June 14, 2016, article by the Post quoted “committee officials and security experts who responded to the breach” and said “DNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April.”“Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed some unusual network activity,” WaPo reported. Dacey enlisted a lawyer from Perkins Coie, who “called in” the private security firm CrowdStrike “to handle the DNC breach.”It’s very curious that the DNC would use the same law firm that Hillary ran to in order to conjure up a fake Trump-Russia collusion document, especially when Former President Barack Obama’s Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson offered his help and was declined, as he testified to in front of congress in June 2017.“The response I got was, the FBI had spoken to them. They don’t want our help. They have CrowdStrike, the cyber security firm,” Johnson said. “I recall very clearly that I was not pleased that we were not in there helping them patch this vulnerability.”Wasserman Schultz strongly disputed Johnson’s testimony.“He’s wrong in every respect,” she said. She claimed she had never been informed of the FBI’s offer and said the FBI was the one who did not loop in high-level officials, saying it did not “do anything other than lob a phone call into our tech support through our main switchboard.”“How is it that the FBI or DHS or any federal agency that was concerned about a foreign enemy state intruding on the networks of one of the two major political parties did not think it important enough to go higher than a tech support staffer?” she asked. “It is astounding and outrageous.”I find it hard to believe that the FBI did so little, and interesting that the first place the DNC turned for help was the crooked law firm of Perkins and Coie.   "
"You know the tax reform being proposed by Republicans that Democrats are calling a tax break for the rich? well a little known provision within the bill is going to increase the top individual rate from 39% to 45%.This new provision  states that Americans who make over $1 million would be taxed at 45% for the next $200,000 they make over that million. This hasn’t been widely advertised by republicans, and it goes against decades of GOP orthodoxy that increasing taxes on the rich discourages economic growth.Steve Moore, a tax expert at The Heritage Foundation had this to say when he found out about the provision: “I was just in a briefing with the White House on this, They didn’t mention that. It seems kind of bizarre to me.”Under the current plan, for every American, the first $45,000 you make it taxed the same, at 12%, under the new plan, that provision would be rolled back a bit for those you make over $1 million.Here’s how the new tax plan would work for those making over $1 million: After the first $1 million in taxable income, the government would impose a 6 percent surcharge on every dollar earned, until it made up for the tax benefits that the rich receive from the low tax rate on that first $45,000. That surcharge remains until the government has clawed back the full $12,420, which would occur at about $1.2 million in taxable income. At that point, the surcharge disappears and the top tax rate drops back to 39.6 percent. This type of tax is sometimes called a “bubble tax,” because the marginal tax rate effectively bubbles up for a brief period before falling back to a lower level.According to POLITICO’s calculation, the surcharge could raise more than $50 billion over a decade."
"The extent at which the mainstream media is willing to go to defend Hillary Clinton is absurd and unfair. There is mountains of evidence being released daily concerning Hillary Clinton and the Uranium One deal with Russia, but instead of there being a public call for justice, the media is instead claiming Trump could be committing a crime just by investigating her?Apparently, because the state is currently investigating Trump for crimes of colluding with Russia, which didn’t happen, he can’t investigate Hillary Clinton for colluding with Russia, which we know did happen, justice right?During an appearance on MSNBC’s “AM Joy” legal analyst Paul Butler laughably claimed that it “absolutely is” obstruction of justice for the government to investigate Hillary Clinton because….. Russia.“Would these attempts to distract from the investigation, even attempting to unseal or remove the gag order from an FBI informant in order to further what is essentially a side investigation that they’re pursuing, is that in itself an element of obstruction?” Host Joy Reid stunningly asked, making clear that she believes selling off 20% of the countries uranium supply to Russia is a “side issue”.“It absolutely is. The statute says if you try to impede a federal investigation, then you are guilty of a federal felony. And with Donald Trump, it’s not just that he asked for a pledge of loyalty from his FBI director. It’s not only that he asked the national security intelligence folks if there’s any way they could thwart the investigations, not only that he reaches out to Michael Flynn after he’s been fired and tell him to keep your head up. I’ll see what I can do. It’s this attitude that he has,” Butler declared.Hillary Clinton has the mainstream media in her pocket and it’s preventing real justice from being served."
"As more and more information comes out about the Clintons and Obama colluding with Russia, and the illegal spying done by the Obama administration, Muller and his team of investigators are desperately trying to find a crime they can pin on Trump.It is common knowledge at this point that Hillary Clinton is being given a pass by the FBI and DOJ for receiving money in exchange for Uranium sold to Russia. She is guilty of having an illegal email server which she destroyed illegally. And we now know that Obama helped out her campaign by spying on the Trump campaign during the campaign and after the election.So why is all of the focus on Trump and the non-existent tie to Russia?Dick Morris suggests that President Trump open an investigation on the Mueller investigation, not a bad idea. Mueller’s investigation is a farce and now  Clarice Feldman at American Thinker reports that Mueller’s team is getting desperate to find any crime related to Trump:I agree with Daniel Greenfield. Based on what I’ve read and observed, while the initial surveillance was to stop Trump and help Clinton, Obama used FISA to provide a “national security” cover for politically spying on Trump right up to the inauguration. As he notes, the first 2016 application was made the month after Trump obtained the nomination and the second in October, the month before the election.As the unmasking picked up pace after the election, the reasonable assumption is that its purpose was to undo the results of the election or hamstring the incoming President.Now Obama and his allies are or should be terrified that the scope of the illegal surveillance is revealing their criminal acts.This is why I believe Mueller is growing increasingly desperate to find one crime by one person he can force by threat of jail to provide any shred of anything that might be used to justify their illegal espionage. Greenfield’s conclusion is apt: “The left is sitting on the biggest crime committed by a sitting president. The only way to cover it up is to destroy his Republican successor. A turning point in history is here. If Obama goes down, the left will go down with him. If his coup succeeds, then America ends.” "
"On Fox News over the weekend, on their “Fox News Sunday” program, House Oversight Committee chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) discussed the situation with the Clintons and the DNC paying for opposition research conducted on President Trump in the Russian-Trump dossier during the 2016 presidential election.Gowdy said he was interested in looking into if the Hillary Clinton campaign attempted to  “launder all of this through a law firm” to avoid transparency laws.Gowdy said, “I’m not an election law expert, but the good news is you don’t have to be too understated the absurdity believing you can just launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm. Imagine if you and I were running for Congress, and we just hired a law firm and said ‘Hey, you go to all the opposition, you go buy all the television, you go buy all the bumper stickers, you go higher all the experts, and we will launder all of this through a law firm. I can’t think of anything that defeats the purpose of transparency laws more than that.”He continued, “I am interested in that, and I am also interested in sharing some memory tricks with folks at the DNC because no one can remember who paid 10 million dollars to a law firm to do oppo research. I find that stunning. $10 million and no one can remember who authorized it, who approved it. So you’ve got two issues, a memory issue and then the lack of transparency by laundering money through a law firm.”The Clinton crime family is going down. Everyday we get more news of more laws crooked Hillary has broken, and sooner or later, I’m sure Trump will be happy to have Hillary Clinton investigated fully, for the crimes we do know, and the ones we don’t which I’m sure are just as damning."
"Do you remember George Papadopoulos from the 1980’s sitcom “Webster”? Well it turns out a man who shares the same name has been arrested months ago by Mullers team and nobody knew until now. The real George Papadopoulos was arrested way back on July 27th and has pleaded guilty on October 5th, but Muller and his team didn’t release the information until October 30th.George Papadopoulos is a campaign staffer who worked on Trumps 2016 presidential campaign, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about contact he had with the Russian government in relation to the 2016 presidential campaign.It’s clear why Muller and democrats wanted to keep this from the public, they need to keep the attention on Trumps relationship with Russia. With all the news coming out about Hillary Clinton, Barrack Obama, and Uranium One, democrats are reeling and they need to keep up public pressure on Trump to keep the focus off themselves.Muller waited months before sharing this information, was he waiting for the public to figure out about Hillary first?This wild goose chase that Muller and the democrats are leading against Trump is sad and it’s real purpose is to keep people’s minds off the real criminals. There is real evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons, and Obama, evidence worth investigating, but all the investigative power in the federal government is being used to fabricate evidence, and muster up false charges against Trump.Don’t be fooled into thinking Muller and the investigators who work under him are by any way impartial, everything they are doing, releasing to the public, has an ulterior motive, they want to control the narrative around the Russian collusion. Protect those who are really colluding, use Trump as a scape goat because politicians don’t like him."
"Robert Manafort was the main target of reports last week after Mueller had gotten a court to approve charges. He has now turned himself in:According to Reuters – Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for U.S. President Donald Trump, surrendered to federal authorities on Monday in the first charges stemming from a special counsel investigation of possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to media reports.Manafort arrived at the Federal Bureau of Investigation Washington field office, television video showed. He was to surrender to federal authorities, the New York Times and CNN reported, citing sources.The charges against Manafort would be the first arising from the investigation by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed to look into alleged Russian meddling to sway the election in favor of Trump.The charges against Manafort would include tax fraud, according to the Wall Street Journal.A federal grand jury issued the indictment on Friday and a federal judge ordered it sealed, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters, adding it could be unsealed as soon as Monday.Manafort associate Rick Gates would also surrender, the Times reported.Lawyers for Gates and Manafort would not immediately return calls for comment.Here’s the reports on what he’s being charged with:"
"In a recent poll, conducted by Harvard-Harris between October 14th and October 18th, support for Sen. Bernie Sanders among liberals is increasing while support for president Trump is decreasing.Sanders’ total favorability in this latest poll is 53 percent, and it is highest among minorities, primarily hispanics (66 percent) and African-Americans (77 percent). His numbers dwarf other leading politicians’ on the left, including Hillary Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.The poll also asked registered Democrats if they are in favor the party moving to more progressive policies and moving further to the left. Fifty-two percent of total respondents were in favor, including 69 percent of millennials, 55 percent of women, 65 percent of Hispanics, and 55 percent of African-American Democratic Party voters.Since Trump’s election in November, several different polls have shown that Sanders is the most popular politician amongst liberals, including previous Harvard-Harris polls conducted earlier this year. Additionally, a July 2017 poll conducted by Morning Consult and a survey conducted by Fox News in March 2017 found similar results.With Democrats so unhappy with the current administration, they are looking to more liberal, and more socialist solutions, like Sanders. Sanders has been the major advocate for Medicare for all as well as other social benefits programs such as college tuition paid for by the government.Sanders has been featured on CNN debates all over the country in recent weeks, debating Ted Cruz (R-Tex) on a variety of issues including health care and tax reform. Sanders is poised to become the Democrats top prospect for the presidential ticket in 2020, which shouldn’t concern too many conservatives. If they democrats want to put their faith in Socialist Sanders, that’s fine with me, all that much easier to defeat come 2020."
"According to what was reported recently by The Washington Post, The D.C. based, international law firm, Perkins and Coie, was directed by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and Hillary Clinton campaign to retain Fusion GPS in April 2016, to create fake dirt on president Trump in an effort to get him removed from office.Fusion GPS then hired a former British spy, Christopher Steele to compile a dossier of allegations that Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.Most, if not all, allegations made in the dossier have been refused, or confirmed false. To cover himself, Steele’s lawyers testified in court that Steele’s work was never supposed to be made public.It has been recently uncovered in FEC records, that OFA, Obama’s campaign arm in 2016, paid nearly $800,000 to Perkins and Coie in 2016.Records show that OFA made two separate payments to Perkins and Coie in early 2016, both under the guise of “legal services”. The first payment totaled close to $100,000, the second totaling exactly $700,000.  Payments from OFA to Perkins Coie in 2017 totaled $174,725 through August 22, 2017.Obama was doing everything he could to make sure Trump was not elected,However, if Clinton had won, OFA would have supposedly been decommissioned. However, due to a Trump victory, the group reassembled, according to this excerpt from NBC news:After a long period of withdrawal from the public eye, Organizing for Action, the political group that grew out of Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, is ramping back up for the Trump era with a focus on defending the Affordable Care Act and training grassroots organizers, officials tell NBC News.Had Hillary Clinton won the presidency, OFA was likely headed for a wind-down. But with Trump in the White House, the relaunched OFA will claim a spot in the increasingly crowded marketplace of groups looking to fight the new president’s agenda.Obama and Hillary are both tied up in the Trump Russian dossier as was suspected, but now there is proof."
"Here comes the start of what will end up being a very long and drawn out trail that will probably lead us nowhere, except that fact that it will probably clear Trumps name. The first charges to be made by special counsel Robert Muller and his team will be carried out on Monday, as they were approved Friday from a federal grand jury in Washington D.C.Muller is leading an investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump or anybody in his administration had or currently has ties with Russian and the Kremlin. It has also been reported but not confirmed that Trump is being investigated by Muller’s team for obstruction of justice.Former Trump campaign chairman Rob Manafort is being investigated by Muller’s team for foreign lobbying and Mike Flynn, a former national security advisor, is being investigated for providing false statements concerning his contact with Russian officials.Subpoenas for documents and testimonies in the probe have been issued by the Mueller team, including from contacts of Manafort.The man overseeing the Muller investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is supposed to be informed of any charges prior to being presented to the grand jury for approval, via rules dictating special counsel investigations.In addition to the Mueller probe, three committees in Congress have been conducting their own Russia-related investigations.It’s about time Hillary Clinton has a whole team of investigators look into her Russian relations, it’s interesting that despite there being a republican administration, no democrats who we know are dirty, are being indicted.It’s only a matter of time before the truth comes out and Trumps name is cleared."
"Democrats are getting desperate now that the Russia-Trump allegations are falling through, they are now contacting psychology professors seeking professional info on the presidents mental state.They are trying to prove that Trump is not mentally fit to serve as president, which is a new low for the democrats.“It’s one thing from my non-professional, non-clinical standpoint [to] believe that someone does not have the capacity to do the job, it’s another thing to talk to experts and [those] who can deal with mental psychosis on a daily basis, so I wanted to hear from them,” Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, told BuzzFeed News.Other notable Democrats, such as Fredrica Wilson have also made claims that Trump is mentally unfit, Wilson went as far as to call Trump a “sick man”. California Senate Candidate Tom Steyer’s ad campaign calls for Trumps impeachment on the ground thats he is “mentally unstable.”Bandy Lee, a Yale Psychology professor, has publicly stated that she has been contacted by a handful of Democratic leaders from both the House and Senate inquiring about the presidents mental state.Duty to Warn, the group that Speier is consulting, was founded by former Johns Hopkins Assistant Professor John Gartner with the help of Lee. The name comes from the fact that phycologists are immune from legal repercussions when disclosing information about a client who exhibits violent behavior.“[We] hope to be to the 25th Amendment what the NRA is to the [Second Amendment],” Gartner told BuzzFeed, though some have accused Gartner and his colleagues of violating the “Goldwater Rule,” which states that mental health professionals cannot diagnose a public figure if they have not personally examined them.Gartner defended the practice however, saying that he doesn’t need to talk to the president face to face to give an assessment.“How do you not need to evaluate someone if you’re going to diagnose their mental health?” Watters asked, though Gartner responded by arguing that “we actually can diagnose people much more reliably by their behavior and by reports of people who know them well.”He also admitted that he hadn’t interviewed or talked to anybody close to Trump, so I don’t know what information this assessment is based off of, just another failed attempt by the Democrats to make Trump’s life harder.   "
"Trumps economy has been booming since his November election, as expected. One of the main selling points for Trumps campaign was his success as a business man, he understands what is good for business and what isn’t, and he would base his policy around that.In the third quarter of 2017, the American economy grew at a 3% rate, continuing it’s success from the second quarter, where the economy grew 3.1%, this according to the most recent data from the bureau of economics.During Trumps campaign and his tenure in the White House, Trump and his cabinet members have repeatedly promised to grow the economy by at least 3%. Republicans in Congress have so far been on board with Trumps aggressive business focused policy, pushing ahead with tax reform to keep the economy strong and in position to grow.The U.S. market has been cruising since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in November for the presidency, posting record highs week after week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the benchmark which we use to analyze the market, is up 4,500 points since November and the market has gained roughly $4 trillion in capitalization.American businesses are investing in the U.S. economy, and more products are being domestically made.Americans themselves are already seeing the benefits of a growing economy. Americans’ disposable personal income in the past two financial quarters increased $198.7 billion and personal savings grew over $1.04 trillion.These are the signs of a strong economy, but this isn’t what people are talking about when they talk about the Trump administration, they distract the American public by talking about the fake Trump and Russia connection, or what the most recent tweet by Trump was.This is what we knew we were going to get with Trump as president, a strong economy, he is definitely delivering on that, it should get more attention. "
"Hillary Clinton claims she had no idea that the Russian dossier was fake, but why then did she spend the months and weeks leading up to the election, playing up the Trump-Russian connection to the public?The FBI launched their Trump-Russia probe in late July of 2016. Per a Politico report from March of 2017:FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers Monday that his agency has been investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials since last July.Right after the FBI announced they were investigating Trump for the Russia connection, Hillary starts tweeting about it, a lot. Seriously, what is going on with Trump and Russia? https://t.co/N6ySNILYMx— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 6, 2016We have some questions about @realDonaldTrump's cozy relationship with Russia. https://t.co/aetHzJyJCo— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) August 8, 2016The very next day August 7th, 2016 Hillary tweeted, “We have some questions about Donald Trump’s cozy relationship with Russia”On August 15th, 2016 Hillary tweeted the same Trump-Russia propaganda video with the caption, “We have some questions about Donald Trump’s cozy relationship with Russia.”On September 7th 2016 Hillary tweeted yet again the same propaganda video and her caption read, The worst part is, this isn’t the first time Donald Trump has praised Russia and Putin. #NBCNewsForum” "
"Hillary is in trouble now! On Wednesday night the DOJ announced they would stop preventing the FBI informant from testifying in court in regards to the Uranium One deal the Clintons made with the Russians during Obama’s administration.Of course Clinton and her team are denying all wrongdoing, including knowledge that the DNC and her campaign team paid for the Trump dossier.Debbie Wasserman Schultz who is tangled up in the Imran Awan Pakistani IT staffer scandal denied having any knowledge of the DNC’s involvement in the funding of the Russian dossier.DNC’s deputy chairman Keith Ellison also threw Wasserman Schultz under the bus by distancing himself from the old DNC leadership:“Tom (Perez) and me, we weren’t even there at the time,” Ellison told The Hill. “I know as much about it as you guys who have reported it.”Hillary is desperately trying to keep this all from falling in on her, but it looks like she might be too caught up in the scandals she created for herself. She’s doing everything in her power to divert attention away from all this, including tweeting about anything else. Children are going to lose their health care. No one should want that. Call your member of Congress and tell them to act: 202-224-3121 https://t.co/oPI6d6NNko— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 26, 2017 She said, “Children are going to lose their health care. No one should want that. Call your member of Congress and tell them to act: 202-224-3121”A desperate attempt to put children’s healthcare in the forefront of people’s minds instead of all her indiscretions.The Clinton crime family is being torn down by the day. The American people are sick of the Clinton oligarchy, they needed to be removed from politics years ago, but in their desperate attempt to cling to power, they decided to illegally frame Trump for communicating with the Russians, and on top of that, they colluded with the Russians themselves. The truth is brutal now that it’s out, but hopefully this is the start of the end for the Clintons.   "
"It has been confirmed that McCain had knowledge that the Trump-Russian dossier was fake. Trump was right about McCain, it’s clear he can’t be trusted. He’s underhanded, by all accounts an angry person, and a bad senator, and this is going to be the straw that broke the camels back in terms of his relationship with president Trump.McCains worst quality as a politician is his lack of loyalty to the republican party. He’s perfectly willing to sell out a fellow republican to receive a fake greeting from the left. During his presidential run he tried to stress his ability to reach across the isle and work with liberals and democrats, I guess this is what he meant. CONFIRMED: John McCain hand-delivered the fake Fusion GPS dossier to Jim Comey for Hillary, in order to get wiretaps on the Trump Campaign— Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) October 26, 2017 McCain admitted that he had taken this information to the opposition party.Sen. John McCain may find himself facing serious questions following the disclosure that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research utilized in the infamous, largely discredited 35-page dossier on President Donald Trump.In December, it was McCain who notoriously passed the controversial dossier documents produced by the Washington opposition research firm Fusion GPS to then FBI Director James Comey, whose agency reportedly utilized the dossier as some of the basis for its probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.But he refused to corroborate the rumor of whether he knew it was fake.A January 11 statement from McCain attempted to explain why he provided the documents to the FBI but did not mention how he came to possess the dossier or whether he knew who funded it.“Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,” McCain said at the time. “That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.”"
"As we all have read at this point, the Clintons are guilty of the same treachery that the Democratic party has been trying to pin on Trump since his election. Slowly buy surely, the mainstream media that just a year ago was lauding over Hilary Clinton, is now publishing story after story, linking her to the Uranium One scandal.This suggests that the globalists in control of mass media are fixing to dump the Clintons much like how Harvey Weinstein was burned, albeit the latter for sexual improprieties instead of political scandals.Just look at this article from The Hill demanding a “special counsel on Hillary Clinton’s Russia scandal:”There was more than enough smoke for the FBI to investigate official government favors in exchange for big donations to the Clinton Foundation, but agents ran into a hyper-politicized Attorney General in Loretta Lynch, whose public integrity section said it ‘did not have enough evidence to move forward,’ according to Washington Post in October 2016.Last week, blockbuster allegations surfaced in The Hill shedding light on what was happening inside the Obama administration and FBI while Russia was seeking control of massive amounts of our uranium supply. It turns out that the Obama administration inexplicably approved the uranium deal with Russia even though the FBI was investigating a massive corruption scheme that included bribery, extortion and other felonies involving Russia’s nuclear energy industry in the United States.This is a huge problem for the Clintons. They have long been treated by the media as basically royalty, but with the Clintons being guilty of the same thing they are accusing Trump of doing, it looks like the media is willing to dump the Clintons in an effort to skewer Trump for the same crimes, in order to not play favorites.We just don’t have any evidence yet of Trump doing anything illegal, but give it 2 weeks, and we will have a treasure trove of incriminating information against the Clintons."
"Multiple media outlets are now reporting that the Hilary Clinton campaign coordinated with Fusion GPS, a D.C. based political opo research facility, to create and distribute the “Trump dossier” with the goal of spreading salacious lies about Trump, that dossier was then used to spur the Trump – Russian investigation.Check out this excerpt from the SEATTLE TIMES:Marc Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington, D.C., firm, to conduct the research. Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community.Elias and his law firm, Seattle-based Perkins Coie, retained the firm in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Before that agreement, Fusion GPS’ research into Trump was funded by a still unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.After the election, the FBI agreed to pay Steele to continue gathering intelligence, but the bureau pulled out of -the arrangement after Steele was publicly identified. The New York Post put it this way:The explosive report in the Washington Post goes a long way to explaining how the dossier was so widely spread among political reporters during the election. The Clinton camp must have passed it out like Halloween candy to its media handmaidens.The Post report provides possible answers to other questions, too. Because Clinton’s team paid for the dossier, it’s likely that she gave it to the FBI, where James Comey planned to hire the former British agent who had compiled it to keep digging dirt on Trump.The finding also raises the possibility that the dossier is what led the Obama White House to snoop on members of Trump’s team, and leak the “unmasked” names to the anti-Trump media in a bid to help Clinton.In short, we now have compelling evidence that the dossier was the largest and dirtiest dirty trick of the 2016 campaign. And Clinton, who has played the victim card ever since her loss, was behind it the whole time.  "
"Victoria Toensing appeared on Hannity recently to leak some incriminating evidence for her client, an unnamed businessman who worked for years as an FBI witness. This man had been previously blocked by the Obama administration from testifying in congress in regards to Russian and U.S. business relations.As we are all well aware of, the Clintons, through a company called Uranium One, brokered a deal to sell Uranium to Russia. As for the nature of Obama’s involvement, not only did he receive these briefings, but so did Director Mueller and other officials. Anybody think Mueller might not be the best choice for Special Counsel now?Kevin Jackson wrote of Mueller a while back:I said at the time when Comey declared his unwavering admiration for Mueller during the Congressional, watch Mueller.I warned that the man is in no way unbiased in his politics. Moreover, he’s anti-Trump. And, he picks anti-Trumpers to his staff.So why is the White House not concerned?Like Comey, Mueller has been given bi-partisan and almost universal praise. Given my knowledge of DC, the praise made me immediately skeptical of the man. The more I have learned, the more I believe my instincts were correct.Yet, President Trump seems rather nonchalant about the whole thing.And what do Leftist do? Deny. Here is Hilary denying:“I would say it’s the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years, and there’s been no credible evidence by anyone. In fact, it’s been debunked repeatedly and will continue to be debunked.”“But here is what they are doing and I have to give them credit. Trump and his allies, including Fox News, are really experts at distraction and diversion. So the closer the investigation about real Russian ties between Trump associates and real Russians, as we heard Jeff Sessions finally admit to in his testimony the other day, the more they want to just throw mud on the wall. I’m their favorite target. Me and President Obama, we are the ones they like to put in the crosshairs.” "
"Today is the anniversary of former president Ronald Reagan signing into law the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The act was the second major law he signed to reform the tax code for the American people.It was a bipartisan effort to decrease taxes and expenses for middle class and working class families in 1981, and again in 1986.The economy took off, marking one of the biggest peacetime economic expansions in U.S. history. Small businesses and dormant factories were brought back to life, the storied American worker produced at record levels, The median family income rose, and American’s exported more products than ever before, stamped with those four beautiful words: “Made in the USA.”Things are different in the 21st century, especially when it comes to taxes. America’s economic competitors are slashing taxes in an effort replicate America’s success. America itself however, became complacent and stagnant.In 2017, we are now one of the highest taxed nations in the world, and the tax code from the 80’s has tripled in length, they now span 2,650 pages, with another 70,000 pages of forms, instructions, court decisions, and other guidance.Our leaders have let the competitive advantage we previously had over other world powers, slip away.The new tax plan being introduced by Trump is supposed to be, above all, simpler. Taxes are not something most people understand if they don’t work in the field. Trump’s new tax plan also promises more tax cuts for the lower and middle classes, starting with doubling the standard deduction, which means the first $24,000 of a family’s income will be tax-free.Our new plan will provide tax relief to businesses of all sizes, and deliver our small and medium-sized businesses the lowest top rate in more than 80 years.the Council of Economic Advisers estimates that it will raise the annual income of a typical, hardworking American household by an average of around $4,000.These are the types of tax reforms the American people need, make taxes easier to understand and just cost less overall, for the individual, and his or her small business, well done Trump. "
"Just when we all thought the political left couldn’t get any lower. Nothing is off limits for the left leaning media, as we saw earlier when CNN berated a Gold Star family who had just lost their son, into slamming Trump. There is nothing Democrats wont do to score the cheapest and lowest quality political points.In the past couple weeks, there has been a false narrative circulating around the media that Trump hasn’t been calling the families of fallen soldiers, and when he does, details about the conversation are taken out of context and lied about in an attempt to make the president look bad.The truth is, no president calls the families of every single fallen soldier in every U.S. conflict, it is factual that Obama, and the administrations before his, rarely called those families.The day after four American soldiers were ambushed and killed in Niger, Trump’s spokeswoman came out and had a statement from the White House about the event, but because Trump personally didn’t make the comments, it didn’t count.The truth is the liberal media is just praying daily that they can stir up controversy with something said by the president because he refuses to capitulate to the overly PC crowd and it’s easy to take his quotes out of context. This is not a matter of quotes being taken out of context however, this is the left leaning media outright lying about what is happening with these Gold Star families.When clownish Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson (D), accused the president of callousness in his condolence call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, it was a new low for a party setting new lows at a record pace. To take a very personal phone call from the President of the United States, to the mother of a fallen soldier, eavesdrop on the conversation, and spread lies about what was said, is an absolute tragedy.   "
"The U.S. war machine is getting ready, as America’s strategic nuclear bombers are on 24-hours alert, to counter potential threats according to a report from Defense One.The preparations for the bombers are taking place at Barksdale Air Force Base, the new headquarters for Global Strike Command, is set to have a multitude of nuclear armed B-52 bombers ready to respond to any threat. The last time a 24-hour alert was placed on our nuclear bombers was the cold war in 1991.Neither General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, or General Lori Robinson, head of U.S. Northern Command, has ordered the shift, but expectations are that such an order will be placed in the very near future, so steps are being taken now.“The world is a dangerous place and we’ve got folks that are talking openly about use of nuclear weapons,” General David Goldfein, Air Force chief of staff, said in an interview during his tour of Barksdale and other related bases, according to Defense One.“It’s no longer a bipolar world where it’s just us and the Soviet Union. We’ve got other players out there who have nuclear capability. It’s never been more important to make sure that we get this mission right,” he added.The most obvious nuclear threat to the United States is the rouge state North Korea. North Korea has twice successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U.S.. On top of that, North Korea has a nuclear arsenal that is growing in size, and they are threatening to use it on the U.S.“Our job is options,” Goldfein said, “We provide best military advice and options for the commander and chief and the secretary of defense. Should the STRATCOM commander require or the NORTHCOM commander require us to [be on] a higher state of readiness to defend the homeland, then we have to have a place to put those forces.”"
"Shame on CNN, they brought a Gold Star family in as a prop to attempt to bash Donald Trump but it did not go as planned. The host started by asking the Murphy’s about their son, how they are doing emotionally, clearly the mother is grieving.So the CNN host figures this would be a perfect time to press the family and get them to attack Donald Trump and the fact that he had not yet given them a phone call.When asked whether or not they had received a call from Trump, Mrs. Murphy said: “No, I haven’t. I haven’t, but it’s OK. It doesn’t matter if I hear from the White House or not because it’s not really about a call or letter. I just want people to remember my son, Specialist Etienne Murphy, and all the other Gold Star moms, Mrs. Johnson, all those who are grieving. Trust me, none of us want to be in the position, and the worst thing I ever have been called is a Gold Star mom.”Mrs. Murphy responded: “I just wanted him to not forget my son. And I actually thank President Trump for ordering the air strike in Syria but it just wasn’t enough to save my child. I have no hard feelings toward anyone because it’s not about me.”“I don’t want it to be about me or a letter, I want it to be about my child [and all of the other military servicemen and women and their families], and what he stood for and what they’re fighting for,” she added.Good for the Murphys to not giving into the pressures of the left leaning media. They tried to use the Murphy’s as a tool amid all the controversy about Gold Star families but the Murphys were not going to let CNN disrespect the memory of their son."
"A Chinese academic with close links to officials inside the country’s defence establishment has revealed that China is prepared to “go to war” with North Korea.In a bombshell of an interview, Chong Sho-Hu, who is a professor of international relations at the Renmin University, in Beijing, said North Korea was “seeking death”.The professor also confirmed that the longstanding relationship between the two countries is over.Despite historic ties between the two countries, president Xi Jinping has reportedly become “fed up” with the erratic behavior of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. Aren’t we all.In the BBC interview, the professor stated that one more missile test and the two countries would be pushed to the brink of war.Apparently after the most recent missile test, president Jinping was reported to be “boiling with furry”. The test happened just as China was gearing up to host a pivotal global economic conference.Professor Sho-Hu, who has ties to China’s defence and foreign affairs establishment, suggested that the time may have come for a military solution to the problem.He said: “The Chinese government is mad, China’s top leader is mad. China wants to punish North Korea.“China once had special relations with the Soviet Union but they had war with that country.“They also had a very special relationship with Vietnam but then they had a war with them in 1979“The relationship between China and North Korea is worse than both of those.“I will say, there are no permanent friends and no permanent enemies.”The professor added: “North Korea is in an awkward situation. No country has ever encountered such tough sanctions before.“If they do nothing, they will starve to death. If they do another ICBM test, they will seek to die.“North Korea is standing on the edge of a deep cliff, one light blow could push this country of the cliff.”Finally an ally of North Korea sees that how unstable they are and sees how bad that is for the future of the world, nobody wants a large scale war, except seemingly North Korea, they don’t have as much to lose as the rest of us. "
"A photo of Lady Gaga and all five, living former presidents went viral on social media this past week as the group of six set out to raise money for disaster relief.Former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama gathered for a benefit concert at the One America Appeal fundraiser. The money is going to the recent victims of hurricanes and flooding in the southern U.S.The joint effort between the group has raised $31 million dollars so far in disaster relief with only announcing the effort hours before the concert.Lady Gaga performed her song “Million Reasons” at the concert, A photo of Gaga and the former presidents quickly went viral on twitter. Nothing but respect for my presidents pic.twitter.com/62s3ULX8Ud— Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) October 22, 2017 Well done Gaga and former presidents. A bipartisan effort to help those in need with no strings or political favors attached is the perfect thing for this country right now.There has been so much animosity on both sides of the political spectrum in this country recently, it’s a beautiful thing to see when there has been so much tragedy in this country from terrorism to natural disasters recently, that regardless of political party, we can come together as Americans and raise enough money to truly make a difference.The men in the picture shown don’t all agree on everything, not even close, but one thing they can all agree on is the fact that this country has seen some hardships in the past few months, and as much as money helps, the image of these men and women coming together to fix a common problem and helping fellow American’s in need is the most important aspect of this fundraiser.Good for Lady Gaga for putting this together, and good for everybody who attended or contributed, this is what makes America great. "
"On Sunday, Trump took a shot at Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) reigniting the feud with the Florida Democrat over the phone call to the fallen soldier.“Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems,” Trump tweeted.“You watch her in action & vote R!”Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action & vote R!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2017 Trump used the same word “wacky” to describe the Democrat in a tweet on Saturday. He said he hopes that the “fake news media” would continue to do stories on Wilson, he is claims is “killing the democratic party.” Trumps comments came after Wilson last week, misrepresented what Trump said on a phone call to the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in Niger.Wilson claims to know the content of the phone call because she was in the car with the family while they answered the phone. She claims Trump said to the widow that he “knew what he signed up for … but when it happens it hurts anyway.”Trump has adamantly denied Wilsons account of the phone call, claiming she is lying about what he said after “secretly” listening in.White House chief of staff John Kelley gave an emotional press conference last week in which he said he was “stunned” but the negative assertions made by Wilson.“I would have thought that was sacred,” Kelly said.Trump spurred controversy when he made the claim last week that Obama and other past presidents didn’t call the families of fallen soldiers at all during this time in office. Former aids to Obama have come to his defense on the issue.This is very petty by Rep. Wilson, and a low blow against the president, for basically eavesdropping on a conversation that she was not apart of, and then telling the public her version of the story as fact. "
"There is a lot to follow in order to get to the bottom of the Clinton uranium one scandal, but once you understand the connections, and who’s profiting, it becomes easy to see why this is so big.it turns out not just the Clinton’s are involved, but the Obama administration, DOJ, and FBI as well.Andrew McCarthy does a masterful job of breaking down the entire scandal from beginning until now.It’s funny to know that the same people leading this Russian which hunt against Trump, were aware of the uranium one scam and helped to cover it up.Here’s just a little of what Andy McCarthy explains to us in his summary:Here’s the kicker: The Uranium One scandal is not only, or even principally, a Clinton scandal. It is an Obama-administration scandal.The Clintons were just doing what the Clintons do: cashing in on their “public service.” The Obama administration, with Secretary Clinton at the forefront but hardly alone, was knowingly compromising American national-security interests. The administration green-lighted the transfer of control over one-fifth of American uranium-mining capacity to Russia, a hostile regime — and specifically to Russia’s state-controlled nuclear-energy conglomerate, Rosatom. Worse, at the time the administration approved the transfer, it knew that Rosatom’s American subsidiary was engaged in a lucrative racketeering enterprise that had already committed felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses.This next part is even worse:The Obama administration also knew that congressional Republicans were trying to stop the transfer. Consequently, the Justice Department concealed what it knew. DOJ allowed the racketeering enterprise to continue compromising the American uranium industry rather than commencing a prosecution that would have scotched the transfer. Prosecutors waited four years before quietly pleading the case out for a song, in violation of Justice Department charging guidelines. Meanwhile, the administration stonewalled Congress, reportedly threatening an informant who wanted to go public."

"Earlier this week, The Hill published a story showing that the Clintons profited off Russian nuclear officials after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton approved a deal allowing for the Kremlin to gain significant control over the U.S. nuclear program.the report from the hill:Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is now demanding answers about why an FBI agent was prevented from testifying about bribery and corruption.“The Executive Branch does not have the authority to use non-disclosure agreements to avoid Congressional scrutiny.  If the FBI is allowed to contract itself out of Congressional oversight, it would seriously undermine our Constitutional system of checks and balances,” Grassley said. “The Justice Department needs to work with the Committee to ensure that witnesses are free to speak without fear, intimidation or retaliation from law enforcement. Witnesses who want to talk to Congress should not be gagged and threatened with prosecution for talking. If that has happened, senior DOJ leadership needs to fix it and release the witness from the gag order.”No doubt Grassley will be looking into the issue with great interest, this is just the beginning."
"Bernie Sanders, the Democratic senator from Vermont, and the 2016 runner-up for the democratic party’s nomination for president told CNN in a debate on Wednesday night that your average American would be happy to pay more in federal income taxes, if they would just understand that it means they would receive more “free” government benefits, including free healthcare, college, and child care.In a televised debate staring Sanders and Republican senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, Sanders told the audience that if he could just explain his economic vision for this country to the people, he’s sure it would be supported.“If we can explain to people, ‘Yeah, you’re going to be paying more in taxes. It’s going to be a progressive tax system,’” Sanders told the crowd, “‘The wealthy are going to pay their fair share, not the middle class, not the working class, but everybody will pay some more. But you’re gonna get free health care, and maybe you’re gonna get free child care, and maybe your kids are gonna be able to go to college tuition-free. You know what? You’re gonna better off than under Ted’s system.’”We understand the system Bernie, we just don’t like it. Lets say for example a plumbing business is run by a small family and they have three children. When these three children graduate high school they are expected to join their family business and learn the trade, a respected alternative to college. Why does their family then have to pay higher taxes for years, something they might or might not be able to afford, to pay for other children to go to college for free?Sander’s economic plan also removes our right to chose. Everybody is forced to pay more for something we might or might not need. Why not pay for what you need, and let the free market and consumers decide the price and what they are willing to pay for services."

Her son, U.S. Army Ranger Benjamin Kopp, had suffered a gunshot wound to the leg.her first reaction to the news is that her son would lose his leg, but it would turn into the worst case scenario. Eight days after being admitted into Walter Reed Medical Center, Kopp died from his injuries.Despite this tragic experience happening eight years ago, Stephenson still lives with that memory every day of her life. She has found coping mechanisms and healing through sharing her son’s story of selfless sacrifice.Stephenson became part of a group known as TAPS, a program that helps military families with the grieving process. To this day, she still advocates for veterans’ issues all across the country.The media is currently bashing president Trump on his comments about former president Obama, not calling military families after the loss of their child overseas. Stephenson shared her experience with Independent Journal Review.“I never got a call,” Stephenson said, “The Obamas never sent these, either.”Then she shared a powerful and heartfelt letter she received from First Lady Melania Trump just after Memorial Day: The letter reads:Jill StephensonSt. Petersburg, FloridaDear Ms. Stephenson,I wish to offer my heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifices you have made and the high price you and your family have paid to help ensure our freedom.As a mother, you bear the burden of war in a very personal way.

"The corrupt tactics of former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton have been revealed, as new evidence has emerged to confirm Peter Schweizer’s account in his bestselling book Clinton Cash, where he details the deal Clinton made wth Russia to have them buy up 20% of U.S. Uranium.John Solomon and Alison Spann report in The Hill:Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.Hilary’s state department was one of eight government agencies to sign of on the uranium deal, however, Clinton was the only one who received $145 million in donations for her family foundation from multiple people connected to the deal, as report by the New York Times."
"California State Assemblyman Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach), one of two Republicans running in the democratic heavy state, says “defunding every sanctuary jurisdiction in the State of California” will be one of his priorities if he becomes the Golden State’s 40th governor.Allen, who’s been apart of the State Assembly for 5 years now, told Breitbart News that defunding California’s sanctuary cities would “absolutely and without a doubt” be one of his top priorities in the first weeks of taking office, assuming he wins the position.“California communities have to be made safe,” Allen said, “It makes absolutely no sense to shelter people who are in our state illegally and committing crimes with taxpayer dollars.”In an op-ed with the Washington Examiner he wrote last week, Allen said:By enacting SB 54 and declaring California a “sanctuary state,” Jerry Brown and liberal Sacramento politicians are draining citizenship of meaning and making a mockery of that history and those aspirations. They have taken a knee to the demands of identity politics – declaring illegal immigrants a protected class, and ordering state and local law enforcement to provide them with special protection.Allen added, “Sanctuary state policies, by their very nature, are contrary to being a nation of laws. As a nation of laws, we cannot pick and choose which ones we’ll obey. In principle, SB 54 is no different than Southern segregationist declarations of “massive resistance” to federal court orders to integrate public facilities.”Back in February, Allen introduced Assembly Bill 1252 (AB 1252), which sought to defund sanctuary cities from receiving state funds. However, Democrats blocked the bill.“I would have defunded every sanctuary jurisdiction in the State of California that either called itself a sanctuary or had sanctuary policies in place,” Allen told Breitbart News this week. “This was voted down along party lines with all Democrats voting no and all Republicans voting yes. It was clearly their agenda from the beginning to make California a haven for people that are here illegally and committing crimes in our communities.”He noted that “in five years in the California Legislature, I’ve been witness to countless great ideas that get killed in committee before they are even voted on in the legislative floor.” He added, “The bottom line is, with supermajorities both in the Senate and the Assembly, Democrats enjoy more power in California than they’ve had any time since the 1880s.” "

After repeatedly being called out on Twitter, 24 hours later, she still hadn’t retracted her statement, deleted the tweet, or even apologized.A CNN colleague of hers took to twitter on her behalf and explained the situation.“McConnell is a polio survivor, a reason why stairs can be tricky at times,” CNN’s Senior Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju wrote. “McConnell often goes up a step at a time, sometimes needs railing for assistance. This time, used Trump for balance.”Diaz was absolutely blasted on twitter, my personal favorite response being: “You’re making fun of the President of the United States helping a polio survivor that stumbled. Stay classy CNN, stay classy.”McConnell is an American hero and a symbol of perseverance and class. He talked about his affliction during his 1990’s reelection campaign as senator of Kentucky“When I was a child and my dad was in World War II, I got polio. I recovered, but my family almost went broke,” McConnell said in the ad.In 2016, McConnell wrote a book about his struggles, “The Long Game: A Memoir” in which he wrote about his battle with polio and the round-the-clock care his mother gave him when he fell ill with the disease at the age of 2.American heros like McConnell should have the utmost respect from Americans, and poking fun at him for a disease he’s had to live with his entire life, one that cause him and his family so much suffering, is a hit well below the belt, and Diaz should be ashamed. "
"We know the left hates the 2nd amendment, but now it looks like they have it out for the 1st amendment as well. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right we have in this country and liberals in Wisconsin are doing their best to try to change the way we exercise freedom of speech.What this boils down to is that liberals want to block the information they disagree with, instead of educating the public and letting them decide for themselves what they agree with. They will say they “want to get the money out of politics”, but in reality the statement should be, “we don’t like the message you are sending so we want to silence it”.The resolution; similar to one passed in 16 other state, reads:Resolved by the assembly, the senate concurring, That the following question be submitted, for advisory purposes only, to the voters of this state at the general election to be held in November 2018:The resolution has to pass both legislative chambers to even get to voters. It’s non-bind nature essentially makes it pointless since it can only urge action, not change existing law. With Republicans controlling the state legislature, few expect any movement on the resolution.Liberals are trying very hard to dismantle the 1st amendment, trying to take freedom of speech away from unions, organizations, and groups we belong to, are we okay with this?"
"The Trump administration has clearly defined when they consider life to begin, and liberals won’t be happy. The Department of Health and Human Services’ strategic plan document for 2018 to 2022 says clearly that life begins at conception.An exert from the document reads: “HHS accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving Americans at every stage of life, beginning at conception.”Which is in stark contrast to the plan that the Obama administration settled on: “HHS accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving Americans at every stage of life.”The main difference obviously being the last line, for the Trump administration, life begins at conception, which presents a huge problem for liberals, and pro-life advocates.They reinforced their mission in a separate exert that left no wiggle room. “A core component of the HHS mission is our dedication to serve all Americans from conception to natural death. HHS seeks to improve health care outcomes for people we serve. While we may refer to the people we serve as beneficiaries, enrollees, patients or consumers, our ultimate goal is to improve healthcare outcomes for all people, including the unborn, across healthcare settings.”The government has placed themselves firmly on the side of life, and defending those who can’t defend themselves. Finally in this country we can see abortion for what it really is, murder. We now have political documentation that might actually make liberals think twice about abortion, make them see that what they are so seemingly so eager to get rid of is the life of a child.The next step is making abortion flat out illegal, it is a barbaric practice that butchers children and ends life early for those who don’t have a voice to protest. "
"As President Trump’s tax reform nears finalization, months after the White House proposed ending a tax break for people in high tax states – Trump grew angry when he discovered that the change could hurt some middle income tax payers.The new information was not made clear to Trump prior, and he had some reservations about the proposal. The president felt so strongly about this information that he suggested “we’ll be adjusting the tax-overhaul framework.” It is not clear how this can pan out for for citizens in the high and middle class tax bracket, but our President is hard at work to satisfy all parties as much as possible.Meanwhile, Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn said Thursday morning that the president “is not rethinking his position on repealing the state and local tax deduction” contradicting what Trump himself said previously.The White House seems to be divided on the issue. Trump has mentioned the innovative to present change to the current proposal while Cohn stated “the president is not rethinking his position on the state and local tax deduction, which allows households to deduct state and local taxes on their federal returns.” And refused to take further questions.With the lack of help and miscommunication that is going on it is clear to see why President Trump is angry about the situation. According to Bloomberg : Roughly two dozen House Republicans are concerned about eliminating the deduction – and he can’t afford to lose too many more votes than that in the House.While the repeal is estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over 10 years, New York Republican Representative Chris Collins had this to say: “And he’s left it to others for the details of how we get there” and “how we pay for it,”Many republicans are confused about our President’s reaction to the details of the tax repeal, has Trump lost it here? More will be discovered as proposal becomes finalized. "
"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) not only thanked the parents of illegal immigrants who brought their children into the country illegally, but went as far as to say that American’s “owe a debt” to them for doing so. American citizenship is a privilege and an honor for any human being, and for Pelosi to legitimately feel like honest American citizens “owe a debt” to those who are receiving free citizenship is absurd and backwards.The term “Dreamers” refers to children below the age of 16, who were brought illegally into America by their parents, and because they spent 5 years in America as illegal citizens, they are granted American citizenship without having to go though the normal and appropriate channels. So basically if you avoid the law and deportation long enough while already benefitting from being in America, you are rewarded with free citizenship. What kind of example does this set for potential illegal immigrants? Why go through the appropriate channels like legitimate immigrants, when you can just come over illegally, and if you are here long enough you are entitled to the same rights and advantages as a legitimate citizen.On top of claiming American citizens “owe a debt” to illegal immigrants, Pelosi also couldn’t help but take a shot a President Trump’s campaign slogan during a CNN town hall with host Chris Cuomo.“Our Dreamers, they make America dream again. They’re so lovely and we, frankly, owe a debt to your parents for bringing you here to be such a brilliant part of our future.”Pelosi was responding to a question from a “Dreamer” who was worried about his status, as reported by the Washington Free Beacon. It is embarrassing the way Pelosi panders to “the Dreamers” and lauds them with praise for accomplishing free citizenship at the expense of hard working Americans."
"President Trump has proposed threats to the Iran nuclear deal, upsetting Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Barack Obama and other world leaders negotiated the 2015 accord, however, Trump has declared it as “the worst deal ever.” According to Trump, the Tehran are not following their pursuit on the bargain. Putin’s spokesman exclaimed, “Obviously if one country leaves the deal, especially such a key country as the US, then that will have negative consequences.” Putin disagrees with Trump regarding the importance of this deal, and is posing threats to the US by stating we will suffer “negative consequences.” Dmitry Peskov informed journalists that “we can only try to predict the nature of these consequences, which we are doing now.”  Trump is anticipating “decertifying” Iran’s accord, in which they agreed to limit their nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. They are not meeting the needs of their agreement and therefore, Trump is taking action. US officials proclaim that by “decertifying” Iran’s compliance to the agreement they will be able to chastise them on other measures they are not following as well.  Every 90 days, the president is required by Congress to certify compliance with Iran. October 15 marks the next date President Trump must do so… or not. Congress is then given 60 days to restore sanctions that were removed from the deal.    "
"According to Foreign Policy Magazine, a series of FBI documents were released to the public this month revealing a new troublemaker group. The FBI identified them as “Black Identity Extremists” (BIE). It is still uncertain what their motive is, but we do know that they are “violent, growing, and racially motivated.” We want to know who is behind this group and exactly what they plan to pursue.    The FBI has identified a myriad of “groups” that stand together under race, likeness in beliefs, or social identity. So what makes this group so distinguishable that the FBI is going to classify them apart from groups such as The Black Panthers, The Congressional Black Caucus, and Black Lives Matter? Considering The Black Panthers, The Weather Underground, FALN, and the Klan, the BIE seem to be individuals responding to social issues that carry out common acts without knowing others in the group.     Problems arise when the FBI classifies people under an identity for their “potential violent threat.” Political activism and rhetoric “may be constitutionally protected,” but these groups respond in anger towards officials or propose “anti-white rhetoric,” which puts them on the FBI radar as the next troublemaker group.    There a total of “nine persistent extremist movements” according the FBI, and the BIE falls under Black Identities. Their legitimacy as a group is due in part to their “acts of protests, advocacy, and civil disobedience.” We can’t let another group intervene with out nation. We must get to the bottom of who these people are and what their goal is."
"It has been noted by a Republican source that Senate Democratic Leader, Chuck Shumer, received a phone call from President Trump regarding health care legislation on Friday. Trump is searching for ideas to restore our health care and is seeking Democratic assistance.  According to a GOP source, Trump is pursuing “a path forward on health care.” In September, President Trump followed similar pursuit with the ‘Chuck and Nancy’ agreements on the debt limit and immigration. Now, we are hearing that Trump is personally speaking with Schumer about our health care. Should we be worried with his course of actions on overcoming certain legislative decisions? We must not let any liberal views hinder our quest for fair health care. Obamacare does not hold the values that health care legislation should, and ultimately failed us. We can’t jump to any conclusions since it is unknown what the phone call between Trump and Schumer exactly entailed. It is unclear Trump’s proposition and Schumer’s response; however, Republicans were nonetheless bewildered by Trump’s doing. A well-informed Republican stated, “It codifies the Rs’ failure on repeal/replace and shows the President can move without hesitation or ideological impediment to make a deal with the Dems. It depresses R base turnout in the midterms, as Trump voters are further disconnected from the Congressional wing.” We must trust our beloved president and know that he has our concerns at the forefront of every decision. Even if he is speaking with Democratic leaders, he knows how important our health care is and he wouldn’t commit to any decisions that upset America."
"The Indianapolis Colts once again managed to disrespect our country at today’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. Vice President, Mike Pence, was in the crowd to support the all American game. The National Felons League players took a knee on their home field as our country’s national anthem was sung. VP Pence was ravaged by their actions and truly showed Americans how to react to such nonsense- walk away from such absurdity. VP Pence will not honor the players of an American tradition who disrespects our nation’s anthem, soldiers, and flag. Nor should he! Indianapolis is known to be rooted in liberal affairs; however, this took the city to a lower standard and showed who they really are. Today, America saw how to react when our unifying anthem was dishonored by the NFL. Can we all come together with VP Pence and make a stance on the true American values? Our flag, National Anthem, and soldiers deserve our love and we want to show them how we unite as one. The cost of a game might hold you back from following VP Pence in his footsteps of walking out of the stadium. Although, that doesn’t stop us from  coming  together and supporting his actions. His bravery and compassion for our country show what America is all about!   I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.— Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017 At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve, and resilience…— Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017 …now, more than ever, we should rally around our Flag and everything that unites us…— Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017 While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem— Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017 I stand with @POTUS Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem. pic.twitter.com/B0zP5M41MQ— Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017"
"Shepard Smith blasted Trump for supporting the anthem, but got instantly shut down.Smith commented, “It’s very clear that for his base, this is the red meat of all red meat. Because they’re able to reframe this. They’re able to say, ‘Oh, they’re attacking the national anthem, they’re attacking the troops, they’re attacking the flag.’”“None of which they’re doing. They’re not doing any of that. They’re upset about racial injustice in the country and they’re upset about the things that the president has said, and yet he’s able to turn it around for his base,” Shepard continued.Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska posted on Twitter, “You have the right to protest Trump tmrw. But aren’t there better ways than kneeling before the flag soldiers died to defend?” Reactions to Shep’s statements were not kind, with one internet commenter writing in response, “Are you really too stupid Shepherd Smith to see that kneeling during the National Anthem is their symbol of flipping off our flag & our country. All the money that you & NFL players are allowed to make is because of those two symbols, representing a country that allows it to happen. So go ahead & take up for people like that, & think about the countries that really have inequality,”This is disgusting.Do you think Shep is a traitor?"
