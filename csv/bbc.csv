"US President Donald Trump will end subsidies to health insurance providers designed to help low income households, as he continues his attempts to dismantle Obamacare.The White House announced the move hours after Mr Trump signed an executive order allowing the sale of health insurance plans which are exempt from some of the law's regulations. The two decisions came after Congress repeatedly failed to repeal Obamacare.The moves were instantly criticised.Democratic Party leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement denouncing the end of subsidies as a ""spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage"" which would harm the poorest citizens.Meanwhile, critics of the initial announcement argued it could de-stabilise the Obamacare market by encouraging healthy consumers to leave their current plans, prompting a spike in premium costs for older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions.But Mr Trump says his plans will provide ""relief"" for people struggling to afford the rising costs, adding that ending the subsidies would ""fix"" the ""imploding"" Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act.According to a statement from the White House, the subsidies, which run into billions each year, were not legal.Following advice from the Department of Justice, the statement said, the Department of Health and Human Services ""concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare"".Some fear this could sound the death-knell for Barack Obama's healthcare law, as insurers pull out of the marketplace.Some within Mr Trump's own party have also been critical, with Florida's Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen warning it would lead to more people being uninsured.Speaking to the press earlier on Thursday, Mr Trump said the White House was just ""starting the process"" of repealing and replacing Obamacare.His executive order would allow small businesses and some individuals to band together and form associations to sponsor coverage across state lines.But it also directs federal agencies to consider easing rules allowing small businesses and some individuals to buy cheaper plans with fewer benefits.The new plans would also lift limits on short-term health insurance plans and circumvent Obamacare regulations requiring ""essential health benefits"" including maternity care, emergency room visits and mental health treatment. The order, however, does not lift the Obamacare individual mandate that requires most Americans to have some form of health insurance or face a tax penalty. It was unclear when the plans would be available but it is unlikely to affect consumers during the 2018 open enrolment period, which begins on 1 November. The Trump administration is likely to face legal challenges from medical associations, consumer groups and some insurers who have railed against earlier repeal efforts. The president added he would continue to press Congress to repeal and replace his predecessor's signature health bill. "
"This week across America, millions of children will be getting ready to go back to school and returning home that evening with their first work assignment - an essay with the title: ""What I did on my summer holidays.""Now imagine for a second you're Donald Trump, and you've just been given that piece of homework. I think the first thing you're going to do is ask for a few extra sheets of paper because, what a summer.From distant, foggy memory, I also seem to remember that the one other instruction you got from the teacher was to make it descriptive, and not too much of a list. Well, sorry about that, Miss. This is what Donald and his pals in the White House got up to:And this is the quiet season. This is the still, millpond of August when nothing happens; when days are long and news bulletins are slim, when surfing dogs and the battle of the bake-offs should dominate the news cycle. Barack Obama's former chief of staff, and now the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, tweeted at one point that he was going to nominate the White House for a Tony award for most drama. Not best drama. Just most.  There is no shortage of pundits and political professionals in Washington who will tell you things can't continue like this, and that there is no way that Donald Trump can last a full four years in office. There is a degree of wishful thinking in that for some people. For others it is a genuine, cold-eyed assessment. I am unconvinced. For a start the drama, the chaos and noise are what this president thrives on. If he hated the drama, he wouldn't stoke and provoke as much as he does. Where it does matter is in his relationships with the lawmakers on Capitol Hill, with the business leaders across the country, with the money men on Wall Street, with the military high command who seem to have bristled at the way their commander-in-chief is behaving and with his fellow leaders around the world.  Just consider for a minute his threat to allow a government shutdown if he doesn't get funding for the border wall with Mexico. The president says it's making good on a campaign pledge: the lawmakers, still under their breath, say: ""Yeah, and the other part of the pledge was that Mexico was going to pay.""He has publicly lambasted the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. On any number of occasions. How does that help him to get an infrastructure bill passed? How does that help to get tax reform through?And then there's the Trump base. Has support for Donald Trump fractured? Yes, a bit. Do the polls that chart approval ratings for him make alarming reading? Yep, the numbers disapproving seem to be rising, and the approving seem to be dwindling.But his base is still 100% with him. Cheering, whooping and lapping it up. He is their man, fighting the system and draining the swamp and taking on the establishment. Just look at the crowds in Phoenix, Arizona, last week.You see, I think there is a perfectly plausible scenario where by a squeak and a cigarette-paper width of margin he gets his legislative agenda through. In which case in 2020 he could go to the American people and say: ""Look, I delivered on what I promised.""There is perhaps a more likely set of circumstances where he is blocked and thwarted - and fails on all the big legislative tests - no repeal and replacement of Obamacare, no significant change to the tax code, no wall with Mexico, no change to America's crumbling infrastructure.But that doesn't mean it's over for Trump. He then goes to the country and says: ""The system is rigged. Draining the swamp is going to take even longer than I ever thought. Parts of the Republican leadership need to be swept away. The fight goes on. We'll Make America Great Again."" And that brings us to Donald Trump's ego - and maybe a choice that this White House must confront as it takes stock of this chaotic summer.Does Donald Trump want to go down in history as a heroic failure, or the winner who turned things around with his relentless energy and deal-making nous?If it's the latter then he needs to start nurturing all those people he has alienated, and in record fast time. And if it's the former, then carry on with the rallies that pump up the base and leave many others feeling queasy."
"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has insisted President Donald Trump wants to resolve the confrontation with North Korea through diplomacy.  It will continue until ""the first bomb drops"", he told CNN.  Sanctions and diplomacy, he said, had brought unprecedented international unity against North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.  Last month, Mr Trump told Mr Tillerson not to waste time seeking talks with Kim Jong-un.  Mr Tillerson's remarks come as the US and South Korea begin their latest joint military exercise in waters surrounding the Korean peninsula, involving fighter jets, destroyers and aircraft carriers.The drills regularly anger the North, and Pyongyang has in the past denounced them as a ""rehearsal for war"".In Sunday's interview, Mr Tillerson again refused to comment on whether he had referred to Mr Trump as a moron after a July meeting at the Pentagon.""I'm not going to deal with that petty stuff,"" he replied, saying he would not dignify the question with an answer.The president responded by challenging the secretary of state to an IQ test but a spokeswoman said later it had been a joke. In recent months, North Korea has defied international opinion by conducting its sixth nuclear test and launching two missiles over Japan.Analysts say the secretive communist state is clearly set on developing a nuclear-capable missile, able to threaten the continental US, despite UN sanctions.At the end of last month, Mr Tillerson disclosed that the US was in ""direct contact"" with the North and looking at the possibility of talks.After months of heated rhetoric, it came as a surprise to some that the two countries had lines of communication.However, the next day Mr Trump tweeted Mr Tillerson to say: ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!""

"Hillary Clinton's long-time adviser Philippe Reines discusses the defeated candidate's new book about the 2016 election, with the BBC's Beyond 100 Days programme. He said the claim that Mrs Clinton had failed to make history was untrue."
"Donald Trump, faced with reconciling a bluntly delivered campaign promise with the tricky realities of governing, again is taking a half-step - and tossing the issue to Congress.On healthcare (repeal and replace - but you figure out how), residency for children who entered the US illegally (Daca protections are illegal, but they can remain in place for six months or maybe longer) and now the Iran nuclear deal, the president has faced sharp disagreement within his administration, leaving Congress to clean up any resulting mess.Legislators don't make great janitors, however. They've repeatedly crashed on healthcare. Legislating Daca hasn't gotten off the ground, as Trump's on-again, off-again deal with Democrats has been replaced by hard-liner demands. As for Iran, the president has decertified the nation's compliance - explaining that it has violated the spirit of the agreement - but Congress will have to decide whether to formally scrap the deal or retool it.The administration recommends legislating ""triggers"" that would automatically impose penalties on the Iranian regime. That will take a lot of legislative manoeuvring - which hasn't exactly been Washington's strong suit lately. Senators Tom Cotton and Bob Corker, who Mr Trump recently accused of facilitating the original Iran deal, have come up with a bill that keeps open the threat of sanctions even after the nuclear restrictions in the original Iran agreement expire. Already, however, some Republican hard-liners are expressing scepticism. If Democrats can't be coaxed into support, any bill seems unlikely to get the 60 votes necessary to pass the Senate.Time is also an obstacle, as cobbling together some type of agreement will have to compete with tax reform, budget negotiations and judicial confirmations on an already packed congressional calendar. In three months, the president must again review Iranian compliance. He says if there's no further action, he'll officially axe the deal.The original Iran legislation was a political contraption that allowed congressional Republicans to object to the agreement without killing it. They voted for a resolution condemning the deal, knowing that President Barack Obama would veto it. Now, it seems, Mr Trump wants new provisions that will flip the equation, allowing him to kill it - or keep it - without getting his hands dirty. If the president so desired, he could unilaterally impose new sanctions on Iran at any time and pull the trigger today, tomorrow or next year. He - or his aides, looking for a way to mollify the president while keeping the deal alive - decided not to do that. Instead, Congress will try to build one complicated legislative construction on top of another. Underneath it all, the Iran deal is still grinding along for now. At some point, however, it could all come crashing down."

"US President Donald Trump has condemned Iran as a ""fanatical regime"" and refused to continue signing off on a landmark international nuclear deal.In a combative speech on Friday, Mr Trump accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism and proposed new sanctions.He said Iran had already violated the 2015 deal, which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear capability in return for easing international embargoes.International observers say Iran has been in full compliance with the deal.Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump said he was acting in order to deny Iran ""all paths to a nuclear weapon"".""We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout,"" he said.Congress requires the US president to certify every 90 days that Iran is upholding its part of the agreement. Mr Trump had already recertified twice, but refused to sign a third time ahead of a Sunday deadline. Congress now has 60 days to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions.Some advocates of the deal, signed between Iran and six international powers - the UK, US, Russia, France, Germany, and China - had feared that Mr Trump would withdraw the US entirely.Instead he essentially passed the ball to Congress, which will now decide whether to rewrite the framework in accordance with Trump's wishes. The president made it clear that if it did not, he would cancel the deal.""In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,"" he said. ""It is under continuous review and our participation can be cancelled by me, as president, at any time.""Mr Trump is seeking is the end to the nuclear deal's so-called ""sunset clauses"", one of which allows for the lifting of restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme after 2025.He also called for new sanctions on Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, which he called the ""corrupt personal terror force of Iran's leader"", and restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile programme, which is not covered by the deal.Last month, Iran said it had successfully tested a new medium-range missile with a 2,000km (1,200-mile) range. The test was not internationally verified.The president said that congressional leaders were already drafting amendments that would curb the ballistic missile development and eliminate expiry dates on restrictions to Iran's nuclear development.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the US was ""more than ever isolated"" and could not change the nuclear deal.""As long as our rights are guaranteed, as long as our interests are served, as long as we benefit from the nuclear deal, we will respect and comply with the deal,"" Mr Rouhani said.Yukiya Amano, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran was implementing the deal and was subject to ""the world's most robust nuclear verification regime"".European diplomats warned that any such unilateral changes to the agreement were likely to trigger the deal's collapse and a return to a nuclear standoff in the Middle East.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called the deal ""robust"" and said there had been ""no violations"" by Iran. She said it was not in the power of ""any president in the world"" to terminate the agreement.In a joint statement, the UK, Germany and France said they were ""concerned"" by Mr Trump's move but remained committed to the deal. They said they ""shared concerns about Iran's ballistic missile programme and regional activities"".Russia said it remained committed to the deal and was opposed to the use of ""aggressive and threatening rhetoric in international relations"".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Mr Trump, who he said had ""boldly confronted Iran's terrorist regime"". Saudi Arabia also backed the US president's ""firm strategy"".By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondentPresident Trump has recast the list of Middle East threats, with Iran replacing Islamic State as Enemy Number One. That world view is shared by his strongest supporters in the region, including Israel and Gulf Arab leaders who have long seen Iran as their primary threat, and a rival with vast sway across the Middle East. They resented Washington's focus on the Iran deal during President's Obama administration. Like President Trump, they want to undo his legacy. The new approach imposes new sanctions but stops short of designating Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group - a step Iran says would be tantamount to a declaration of war. The urgent question now is whether the new strategy will embolden Iran's hardliners including the Revolutionary Guards. Like US forces, they're involved in battles to defeat IS in Iraq and Syria, and may also see a new enemy. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News WashingtonDonald Trump, trying to reconcile a bluntly delivered campaign promise with the tricky realities of governing, is taking a half-step - and handing the mess to Congress.Legislators do not make for great caretakers, however, and without firm White House guidance Iran may prove a daunting challenge. The president has decertified Iran's compliance, but Congress will have to decide how to fix the deal to his liking.The administration recommends establishing ""triggers"" that would automatically impose penalties on the Iran. That will take a lot of legislative manoeuvring, not Washington's strong suit lately. There are signs of progress in Congress, but with tax reform and budget negotiations continuing, the schedule is packed. At some point Mr Trump could again be on the spot. He says if there's no further action, he will officially nix the deal.The original Iran deal legislation was a way to allow congressional Republicans to object to the agreement without killing it. Now, it seems, Mr Trump wants new provisions that will allow him to kill it - or keep it - without getting his hands dirty. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it is designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon.It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil.The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must curb its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years and allow inspectors into the country."
"President Trump made a number of claims about the economy in his first answer on Sean Hannity's programme on Fox News on Wednesday.This is what he said: ""The country - we took it over, it owed $20 trillion. As you know, the last eight years they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10tn, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2tn just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say in one sense, we're really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we're reducing debt.""Let's go through that one claim at a time.The Treasury handily gives daily updates on the level of debt, which is the total amount owed by the US government.On 20 January 2017, the date of the president's inauguration, the total outstanding public debt was $19.95tn (£15.2tn).So he's right on that one.Nearly right. On 20 January 2009, when President Obama was sworn in, the debt was $10.63tn. The difference is $9.32tn, which is not more than $10tn, but is still a lot of borrowing.Comparing figures with the amount of debt borrowed in the whole history of the country is a bit tricky. We have to assume he means since 1789, because that's when the US Treasury's records go back to.Clearly there are problems with this comparison, because the economy in the late 18th Century is in no sense comparable with the one today.If we take the outstanding debt on inauguration day in 2009 as the total amount borrowed since 1789, then President Obama did not borrow more than that, he borrowed $1.31tn less than that. Of course, that net debt figure is not the total amount borrowed. The total amount borrowed will be considerably more than that because some debt will have been repaid over the last few hundred years.And if it's not quite true in cash terms over that period then it will certainly not be true using any measure that takes into account the growth of the economy.Bloomberg's US exchange market capitalisation (measuring the value of all listed companies) puts the current value at $28.39tn, while the value the day after the inauguration was $25.55tn, so that's an increase of $2.84tn.But we know from President Trump's Twitter account that he was actually comparing with the level on election day. Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25% increase. Lowest unemployment in 16 years and..End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpOn 8 November, the market capitalisation was $23.89tn, so it has grown by $4.5tn.That's not quite $5.2tn but it's still growth of about 19%, which is pretty hefty.This bit is harder to interpret, but it sounds like he is comparing the US debt with the value of the shares on the US stock exchange.Market capitalisation is not the government's money - it is shareholders' money.It might lead to more taxes being paid eventually, but the two figures do not belong in the same category.Remember, on inauguration day, the debt was $19.95tn.Well, the Treasury's latest figure for 10 October was $20.38tn, so that's gone up by $430bn.Debt did actually fall in the early months of the presidency, but it jumped on 8 September when the president signed a bill raising the debt ceiling.Read more from Reality CheckFollow us on Twitter"
"There was a time when President Trump's refusal to certify the Iran nuclear deal would have sent the British foreign policy establishment into a tailspin. His campaign attacks on what he called ""the worst deal in the world"" left policymakers in the UK fearing that here, finally, was an issue on which Britain's relationship with the US could founder. Mr Trump believes that Iran is no longer restricting its nuclear programme enough to justify the sanctions relief it enjoys. As such, he will no longer certify US support for the agreement. The UK disagrees and believes Iran is complying fully. These are two positions that cannot be reconciled. British ministers and officials loathe being at odds with Washington. They find it a culturally difficult place for them to be. And as they prepare to leave one traditional pillar of British foreign policy, the European Union, they want to stick even more closely to the other pillar, namely the United States.  So for the UK and the US to be utterly divided over a central plank of international policy is no little thing. Britain had to choose between its allies in America and Europe and it has taken the path of its continental partners. But if one listens carefully along the corridors of Whitehall, there appears to be little sign of panic. There is a huge transatlantic divide and yet no-one is declaring the ""special relationship"" to be dead.  Of course, officials and diplomats are worried about the substance of the issue itself. They fear that the simple act of decertification will weaken the nuclear deal. They believe there is a huge risk involved in handing the issue over to Congress. What if US politicians try to reopen the agreement? What if they lay down new so-called ""trigger points"" that are so stringent that Iran cannot comply and sanctions are reimposed automatically? Any breakdown of the nuclear deal could have a huge impact on regional security in the Middle East, on Britain's economic access to Iran and even on the behaviour of North Korea. But if diplomats are concerned about the issue, they seem less nervous about the consequences for Britain's relations with the US. And here is why: the behaviour of the Trump White House has given them leave to be less worried. The fact that the president is so at odds with parts of his administration and party has made it legitimate for traditional allies to share those differences too. It is almost as if the Trump modus vivendi has made it even more obvious that the transatlantic relations that matter are the historic state-to-state contacts between the different agencies of government rather than the personal relations between individual leaders.This week Theresa May had a telephone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And in it she went out of her way to challenge Mr Trump's thinking on Iran. Not only did she praise the nuclear deal but she also refused to make any connection - as Mr Trump does - between it and Iran's regional aggression. She did this only days before Mr Trump's big speech. And yet despite this, the house did not fall in. There was no diplomatic row. No-one said the British prime minister was snubbing the US president. Her comments were hardly considered news. Britain's ambassador the US, Sir Kim Darroch, has been equally robust, touring the foreign policy think tanks to list the benefits of the nuclear deal: how many fewer centrifuges Iran now has and how much less uranium. His embassy has been tweeting ""how the Iranian deal is working"". And Sir Kim has spent hours and hours on the Hill with his French and German counterparts explaining to senators and members of congress why the deal matters. The real fear among British officials is not the impact on US-UK relations but the damage to Western credibility in the international sphere; the signal that it sends to other countries that it is not worth doing deals with the US because they might just turn round and tear them up a few years later. What message does it send to China, for example, over any deal that might be done with the US over North Korea? Baroness Ashton, the former EU foreign policy chief who negotiated the Iran deal, told me this week that getting a diplomatic solution to the North Korea crisis would be ""much harder"" if countries think ""an agreement reached by one US president will not be honoured by another"". Once again Donald Trump has shown himself willing to break the traditional rules of the international order. And once again there will be consequences for the rest of the world. "
"Israel has said it will join the US in pulling out of the UN's cultural organisation Unesco, after US officials cited ""anti-Israel bias"".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US decision as ""brave and moral"", a statement said.The agency is known for designating world heritage sites such as Syria's Palmyra and the US Grand Canyon.Unesco head Irina Bokova earlier called the US withdrawal a matter of ""profound regret"".The US withdrawal will become effective at the end of December 2018 - until then, the US will remain a full member. The US will establish an observer mission at the Paris-based organisation to replace its representation, the state department said.Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu tweeted he had instructed his foreign ministry to ""prepare Israel's withdrawal... in parallel with the United States"".By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondentUnesco is an easy target for US President Donald Trump - it is a multilateral body with educational and developmental goals like promoting sex education, literacy and equality for women.  The US withdrawal will be seen by many as a manifestation of Mr Trump's ""America First"" approach and his across-the-board hostility to multilateral organisations; the irony being that Unesco is part of the international architecture that the US helped to establish in the wake of World War Two.  But it is the organisation's perceived anti-Israel bias that is the fundamental issue here. It has condemned Israel in the past for its activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and earlier this year it designated the old city of Hebron a Palestinian World Heritage Site - a step Israel insisted denied centuries of Jewish history there, not least the Tomb of the Patriarchs that dates back to biblical times.The decision follows a string of Unesco decisions that have drawn criticism from the US and Israel.In 2011 the US cut its funding to the agency in protest at its decision to grant full membership to the Palestinians.And last year, Israel suspended co-operation with Unesco after the agency adopted a controversial resolution which made no reference to Jewish ties to a key holy site in Jerusalem.The resolution also criticised Israel's activities at holy places in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.Then earlier this year, Mr Netanyahu condemned Unesco for declaring the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank a Palestinian World Heritage site.He accused Unesco of ignoring Judaism's ancient connection to the city, which includes the crypt where its matriarchs and patriarchs are buried.Unesco's troubled timelineNovember 1945: Unesco founded by 37 countries in the immediate aftermath of World War Two, its purpose ""to contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among nations through education, science and culture"".1974: Congress suspends US contribution after Unesco criticises Israel and recognises the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) - but later rejoins.1984: Under President Ronald Reagan, US withdraws from Unesco, saying the agency is politically left-wing and financially irresponsible.1985: UK withdraws, rejoining under change of government in 1997.2003: US rejoins under George W Bush.2011: US withdraws funding in protest at Palestinian membership of UN; arrears begin to accumulate.2017: US announces it will withdraw entirely; Israel says it will follow suit.Yes. As well as accusing Unesco of bias, the US state department said it was also concerned about mounting financial arrears at the agency and said it should be reformed.But that's mainly due to the US decision to cut more than $80m (£60m) worth of funding to the agency amid the furore over Palestinian membership six years ago - slashing its budget by 22%.Reports say the US withdrawal is also motivated by a desire to stop accruing arrears to the agency itself. Despite suspending funding the US continues to be charged, and now owes more than $500m.Mr Trump has criticised what he sees as a disproportionate contribution by the US to UN institutions. The US funds 22% of the UN's regular budget and 28% of UN peacekeeping.Unesco chief Ms Bokova said the withdrawal represented a loss to the ""UN family"" and to multilateralism in general.But she admitted that ""politicisation"" had ""taken its toll"" on the organisation in recent years.Ms Bokova told the New York Times that she had informed members of Congress repeatedly that immediate payment of US arrears to Unesco was not an issue, and that American re-engagement in the organisation was the priority.But she questioned the timing of the announcement, coming as Unesco chooses a new leader.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he ""deeply regretted"" the US decision but that the UN would continue to ""interact with the United States very productively on a range of issues through a range of organisations"".The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) applauded, saying that for years, the agency had ""betrayed its original laudatory mission... and chosen instead to unfairly target the Middle East's lone democracy, Israel"". Russia said it regretted the decision, but agreed Unesco was too politicised. President Vladimir Putin's aide for culture Vladimir Tolstoy reportedly called the news ""flabbergasting""."
"President Trump says if talks to reform Nafta fail, he could envisage a US-Canada trade pact, excluding Mexico.The US president said if there was no deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement, it would be terminated. He was speaking at the White House with visiting Canadian PM Justin Trudeau.Replying to a question, Mr Trump said he said he would consider a trade pact with Canada minus Mexico, adding that both the US and Canada wanted to protect their workers.The current round of talks on renegotiating the trade bloc is reported to be stalling, with Mexico opposing a US move to increase the percentage of US-made components in car manufacturing. Mr Trump's stance has however been criticised by US businesses, And Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray, speaking ahead of the latest round of talks, said terminating Nafta could harm US-Mexico relations and damage co-operation on issues like fighting drug-trafficking. Mr Trudeau said he believed the Nafta talks could still end in a ""win, win, win"". But he said that Canada had to ""be ready for anything"" if the attempts to modernise the 23-year-old deal faltered. Overall trade between the three Nafta partners reached $1.1 trillion (£832bn) in 2016. American and Mexican officials say they want a renegotiated deal by December. This week the influential US Chamber of Commerce warned it was time to ""ring alarm bells"" over the Nafta talks. The business lobby group said there were ""several poison pill proposals"" put on the table by the US that could tank the renegotiations. Those include US demands to adjust the rules of origin, which would increase the percentage of the content of car parts and other materials that would come from Nafta countries in order for a good to qualify as duty free - a specific concern for the North American auto industry. The US and Canadian leaders also discussed the Bombardier-Boeing trade dispute. Canada and the UK are sparring with the US over Canadian aerospace giant Bombardier.The Trump administration has imposed hefty duties on Bombardier's C-Series jetliner.  American aerospace firm Boeing claims Bombardier received unfair government subsidies to produce its showcase passenger jet. Bombardier is a significant employer in Northern Ireland and Canada. Mr Trudeau said he ""highlighted to the president how much we disagree vehemently"" on the decision to impose anti-dumping duties. "
"The US deputy attorney general says the use of ""warrant-proof encryption"" in popular apps and operating systems, is hampering law enforcement.Several apps encrypt communications end-to-end, which stop messages being legible if intercepted by criminals or law enforcement.In a speech, Rod Rosenstein said law enforcers were increasingly thwarted by such encryption.He met Home Secretary Amber Rudd on Thursday to discuss the issue.He will also meet the head of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency.""Increasingly, the tools we use to collect evidence run up against encryption tools which are designed to defeat them,"" said Mr Rosenstein, speaking at the Global Cyber Security Summit in London.He said the United States was ""co-ordinating with our foreign partners as to what the challenges are"".With end-to-end encryption, messages are scrambled when they leave the sender's device and are decrypted only on the receiver's device.It means service providers such as WhatsApp cannot hand over a legible copy of a suspect's messages to law enforcement, because they do not have one.Mr Rosenstein said technology companies often ""resisted co-operating with governments"".Ms Rudd has also described encryption tools used by messaging apps as a ""problem"".In August, she met representatives from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and others at a counter-terrorism forum in San Francisco.She called on companies to work ""more closely"" with the government but said she did not want to ""weaken encryption""."
"US President Donald Trump has griped about emergency relief efforts in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying federal aid cannot continue ""forever"".In tweets, he accused Puerto Rico of a ""total lack of accountability"", adding that ""electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes"".The island, whose 3.4 million residents are US citizens, is 90% without power, some three weeks after Hurricane Maria.On Thursday, Congress approved a $36.5bn (£28bn) disaster relief bill.The cross-party bill, which still requires Senate approval, provides emergency storm relief for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and the US Virgin Islands, as well as wildfire-ravaged California. In Thursday's morning tweets, the US president noted it was up to ""Congress to decide how much to spend"".But he added: ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!""   The mayor of Puerto Rican capital San Juan said Mr Trump's tweets highlight his ""desperation"" and the ""inadequacy"" of the hurricane response.""It is not that you do not get it,"" Carmen Yulin Cruz added, ""it is that you are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done.""White House chief of staff John Kelly said later the US would stand with Puerto Rico ""until the job is done"".He also said the president was ""exactly accurate"" to assert that federal personnel are ""not going to be there forever"". The storm killed at least 45 people in the US territory, while more than 100 others remain unaccounted for, say Puerto Rico officials.The island is saddled with about $72bn in pre-hurricane debt that is being overseen by a federally created oversight board.Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporterImagine a devastating hurricane hits New York City, and the president repeatedly notes how bad things were there before the disaster. Or, three weeks after an earthquake levels Los Angeles, he says the government won't provide aid ""forever"".There would be outrage. It's difficult to even imagine such responses.That, however, is how Donald Trump is handling hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. For the president, the US territory - occupying a political no-man's land between US statehood and independence - is different. When the chequebook comes out, empathy ends and reality sets in. The administration and Congress are in the middle of tough negotiations over government spending and tax reform. Coming up with billions for Puerto Rico relief is an unwelcome challenge.So the president has said there is a limit to the help available for these taxpaying US citizens. Things were bad before - and they may stay that way.Mr Trump's tweets also provoked a backlash from some Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of preparing to abandon US citizens. ""There is still devastation, Americans are still dying. FEMA needs to stay until the job is done,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer replied on Twitter, using the acronym for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Puerto Rico-born congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, another New York Democrat, tweeted that Mr Trump's comments were ""outrageous, indefensible and irresponsible"", adding: ""We will not allow our government to abandon our fellow citizens.""She has written to the Department of Homeland Security to request an investigation into the official death toll, which she says may be vastly under-reported, and could be as high as 450.""The federal response is woefully adequate and now we are seeing numerous reports that the death toll is unknown or not being reported accurately,"" she wrote in a letter co-authored with Congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. ""The whole nation deserves to know what is happening to our fellow citizens.""President Trump visited the US territory last week, where he told residents that recovery efforts had ""thrown our budget a little out of whack"".He also said the islanders should be ""very proud"" the death toll was not as high as a ""real catastrophe"" like Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005.The US president was pilloried by local officials after he threw rolls of paper towels at residents during his trip.The San Juan mayor described that incident as ""abominable"".But Mr Trump later depicted the outrage as confected, insisting to the Trinity Broadcasting Network that the crowd ""were having fun"" as he distributed ""these beautiful, soft towels""."
"Google has found evidence that Russian agents spent tens of thousands of dollars on adverts in a bid to sway the 2016 US election, media reports say.Sources quoted by the Washington Post say the adverts aimed to spread disinformation across Google's products including YouTube and Gmail.They say the adverts do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-linked source that bought ads on Facebook.Google said it was investigating attempts to ""abuse"" its systems.US intelligence agencies concluded earlier this year that Russia had tried to sway the election in favour of Donald Trump.The Russian government strongly denies the claims and President Trump has denied any collusion with the Kremlin.The issue is under investigation by US congressional committees and the Department of Justice.Sources said to be close to the Google investigation said the company was looking into a group of adverts that cost less than $100,000 (£76,000).Google said in a statement: ""We have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion. We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries.""Microsoft said on Monday it was also investigating whether any US election adverts had been bought by Russians for its Bing search engine or other products.A spokesman told Reuters it had no further information at the moment.Facebook said in September that it had uncovered a Russian-funded campaign to promote divisive social and political messages on its network.It said that $100,000 was spent on about 3,000 ads over a two-year period, ending in May 2017.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg later said his company would pass the information to US investigators."
"US President Donald Trump has raised the prospect of challenging media licences for NBC News and other news networks after unfavourable reports.He took aim at NBC, which made him a star on The Apprentice, after it reported he wanted to boost America's nuclear arsenal almost tenfold.Mr Trump labelled the report ""fake news"" and ""pure fiction"".NBC also angered the White House last week when it said the secretary of state had called Mr Trump ""a moron"".Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: ""With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!""Welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Washington later in the day, the US president denied the NBC story.""It is frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it,"" he said at the White House.When asked if he wanted to increase the country's arsenal, Mr Trump said he only ever discussed keeping it in ""perfect condition"".""No, I want to have absolutely perfectly maintained - which we are in the process of doing - nuclear force.""But when they said I want 10 times what we have right now, it's totally unnecessary, believe me.""He added: ""I want modernisation and I want total rehabilitation. It's got to be in tip-top shape.""Defence Secretary Jim Mattis also disputed NBC's story.""Recent reports that the President called for an increase in the US nuclear arsenal are absolutely false,"" he said in a statement.  ""This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible.""The president's tweet about US broadcast networks provoked a free-speech uproar.Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, tweeted: ""Mr President: Are you recanting of the Oath you took on Jan 20 to preserve, protect, and defend the 1st Amendment?"" Walter Shaub, who led the US Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama, said it could lead to ""the point when we cease to be a democracy"".The Committee to Protect Journalists said the US president's comment was a poor example for other world leaders.According to NBC News, Mr Trump told a top-level meeting at the Pentagon in July that he wanted to dramatically boost the American stockpile of atomic missiles.He reportedly made the request after seeing a downward-sloping curve on a briefing slide charting the gradual decrease in US nuclear weapons since the 1960s.Attributing its report to three officials in the room, NBC said Mr Trump's request surprised those present, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.The network reported that Mr Trump had also called for additional US troops and military equipment.The US has 7,100 nuclear weapons and Russia has 7,300, according to the US non-partisan Arms Control Association.Media commentators say the president would struggle to remove broadcasters' licences if he wished to do so.The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates US broadcasters, issues licences not to networks as a whole, but to local stations.NBC owns nearly 30 local stations.It would be difficult to challenge a licence on the basis that coverage is unfair, say pundits.Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporterLast week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders assured reporters that Donald Trump was an ""incredible advocate"" of constitutional free-press protections. This week, the president is contemplating  whether a broadcaster could be forced off the airwaves because he doesn't approve of its news coverage.Never mind that the federal government licenses local televisions stations, only some of which are owned by national broadcasters like NBC. Just because a threat is unworkable in the extreme doesn't mean the president won't make it. Media-bashing is one of Mr Trump's favourite pastimes - a means of venting frustration, apportioning blame and, perhaps, distracting reporters who always enjoy a bit of journalistic navel-gazing.  As with the NFL anthem-kneeling controversy, the cultural battle lines form quickly when it comes to questions of media bias. The president knows this and uses it to his advantage.Taking pot-shots at journalists is one thing, of course. Contemplating the use of government coercion to stifle a broadcaster because of its news content is another. Even if such an outcome is unthinkable in the US at the moment, there are places in the world where press freedoms aren't as deeply entrenched. Their leaders are watching the president, too."
"US President Donald Trump has challenged his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to an IQ test, in the latest sign of discord between the two.He made the remark in a magazine interview when asked about reports that Mr Tillerson had called him a moron.""I think it's fake news,"" Mr Trump told Forbes, ""but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.""Mr Trump had lunch on Tuesday with Mr Tillerson.Shortly beforehand, the president maintained he still had confidence in the secretary of state.""I did not undercut anybody,"" he also told reporters. ""I don't believe in undercutting people.""Asked about Mr Trump's IQ test challenge, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the daily news briefing: ""It was a joke. You should get a sense of humour.""Reports have swirled of a schism in the Trump administration between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat, as the US faces a host of vexatious foreign policy conundrums, from North Korea to Iran.Last week Mr Tillerson called a news conference to dismiss reports that he was considering quitting.But the former ExxonMobil chief executive did not deny an NBC News report that he had called his boss a moron after a July meeting at the Pentagon.Earlier this month, Mr Trump publicly undercut the former Texas oilman by tweeting that he was ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with nuclear-armed North Korea.Last week the New York Times reported that Mr Tillerson was astonished at how little Mr Trump grasps the basics of foreign policy.According to the newspaper, quoting sources close to the secretary of state, Mr Trump has been irritated by Mr Tillerson's body language during meetings.Mr Tillerson is said to roll his eyes or slouch when he disagrees with the decisions of his boss.Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporterDonald Trump insists that the stories about Rex Tillerson insulting his intelligence - despite being heavily sourced - are ""fake news"". Now, however, he's lobbing one of his trademark counter-punches, just in case.Mr Tillerson thinks he's a moron? Well, he's smarter than Rex, that's for certain. It's classic Trump - a slightly less juvenile version of the ""I guarantee you there's no problem"" retort Mr Trump snapped off during a Republican debate, when Senator Marco Rubio questioned the size of his, er, manhood.Mr Trump tends to get touchy when people doubt his intellect. That's probably why the ""moron"" line has prompted such a furious response from the White House and State Department. During the campaign he said he doesn't have to consult generals because he has ""a very good brain"" and told a rally in South Carolina that he was highly educated and has ""the best words"". In August, he boasted that he was a ""better student"" and went to better schools than all his elite critics. Mr Tillerson may have opened a difficult-to-repair rift with the president. While Mr Trump is quite comfortable with insult-trading, there's one topic that's clearly off-limits."
"US President Donald Trump could put the US ""on the path to World War Three"", the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has warned.Senator Bob Corker said Mr Trump was treating the presidency like ""a reality show"". The retiring Tennessee lawmaker also said White House staff struggle to ""contain"" Mr Trump.Mr Corker's comments are a remarkable attack on a sitting president from a member of his own party.Mr Corker was considered for the job of secretary of state by Mr Trump last year but they have since fallen out.By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporterDonald Trump has gone after members of his own party before. Most, however, have chosen to grit teeth and suffer in silence.Not Bob Corker. Maybe there's something liberating about knowing you don't have to face an angry pro-Trump electorate next year. Maybe, as head of the foreign relations committee, the Tennessee senator feels compelled to condemn the havoc he believes Mr Trump is causing to US foreign policy.The president hasn't responded to Mr Corker's stinging rebuke yet, but according to a White House official, the president is ""not finished with Corker"".The problem for the president is that, although Mr Corker is retiring, he's not leaving the Senate until January 2019. Until then, he's chair of a powerful committee and a key vote in a chamber where only few party defections will sink any Republican-backed legislation.The president may be settling scores with the Tennessean, but it could come at a high price.Four ways Corker skewered TrumpFollow @awzurcherThe senator told the New York Times in a telephone interview on Sunday he was concerned about the president's conduct. ""I don't think he appreciates that when the president of the United States speaks and says the things that he does, the impact that it has around the world, especially in the region that he's addressing,"" he said.Mr Corker suggested the president - who has repeatedly baited nuclear-armed North Korea -  could put the US on course for ""World War Three"".""I don't know why the president tweets out things that are not true,"" he added. ""You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.""""I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him,"" Mr Corker told the newspaper. The ill-tempered exchange began on Sunday morning, when Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Corker had begged the president to endorse him for re-election.Mr Trump said he refused. He also accused Mr Corker of being ""largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal"".Mr Corker, who denied the president's account, responded: ""It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. ""Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.""Mr Trump is this week expected to de-certify the Obama administration's 2015 agreement to curb Iran's development of nuclear weapons, a deal he has repeatedly condemned.Last month Mr Corker - who has said the Iran deal should not be torn up - announced he would not seek re-election at next year's mid-term elections. Mr Corker and Mr Trump previously clashed in August when the senator criticised the president's response to clashes that month between white supremacists and anti-fascist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia.Mr Trump's attack followed Mr Corker's expression of support last week for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is widely seen as having been sidelined by the president.Mr Corker said America's top diplomat was ""in an incredibly frustrating place"", where he ""ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported"".On Wednesday Mr Tillerson denied rumours that he was about to resign, amid reports he had referred to the president as a moron."
"The White House has tied any new deal on young undocumented immigrants to a clampdown on illegal immigration, including a border wall with Mexico.  US President Donald Trump is asking for funding for the wall, speedier deportations and the hiring of thousands of new immigration officials.Last month he ended the Obama-era ""Dreamer"" programme which had protected some 690,000 immigrants.Leading Democrats in Congress have rejected the latest proposals.They accused Mr Trump of backtracking on a commitment not to include the border wall in negotiations over the status of young immigrants, who are mostly from Mexico and other Latin American countries.The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, set up in 2012 under President Barack Obama, is due to expire in March, casting doubt on the future of those protected. The list of ""principles"" delivered by the White House to Congress on Sunday includes:""These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients,"" Mr Trump wrote in a letter to Congress accompanying the list. His legislative affairs director, Marc Short, said the priorities were ""essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to Daca recipients"".Last month, Mr Trump told Congress, which is dominated by his Republican party, it had six months to agree new legislation to help the Dreamers.They are young people who were brought to or entered the US illegally as children and as such faced deportation. Under Mr Obama's policy, they were able to apply for work and study permits but critics said the scheme amounted to an amnesty for illegal immigrants.Since the scheme was introduced, about 100,000 recipients have seen their status lapse or change, leaving about 690,000 recipients today.In order to qualify for Daca, applicants under the age of 30 submitted personal information to the Department of Homeland Security.They had to go through an FBI background check and have a clean criminal background, and either be in education, have recently graduated or have been honourably discharged from the military.In exchange, the US government agreed to ""defer"" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years.""The administration can't be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,"" House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement.""The list includes the wall, which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations. If the president was serious about  protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so.""Mr Schumer and Ms Pelosi said in a statement after a meeting with Mr Trump last month that he had told them funding for the wall would not be part of a Daca deal.However, the next day White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that ""excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to"".It was one of Mr Trump's most controversial election pledges but debate has raged over how it will be funded.The US leader insisted Mexico itself should pay but the authorities there have rejected the idea.Meanwhile, a prototype was erected near San Diego, California, last week."
"In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, gun control advocates are renewing calls for tightening regulation on firearms.If the story sounds familiar, it's because a similar dynamic has played out time and time again in recent years, after every new gut-wrenching incident of gun violence makes headlines.On the federal level, at least, the interest and attention in new legislation has led to almost no action in decades, despite numerous polls showing widespread public support for measures like strengthened background checks and banning certain types of high-capacity gun magazines and military-style assault rifles.With such a high death toll this time, perhaps the pressure for change will be greater. Here are five big obstacles that stand in the way.The National Rifle Association is one of the most influential interest groups in US politics - not just because of the money it spends on lobbying politicians, but also because of the engagement of its 5 million members.It opposes most proposals to strengthen firearm regulations and is behind efforts at both the federal and state levels to roll back many existing restrictions on gun ownership. In 2016 the NRA spent $4m on lobbying and direct contributions to politicians as well as more than $50m on political advocacy, including an estimated $30m to help elect Donald Trump president.Its overall annual budget is roughly $250m, allocated to educational programmes, gun facilities, membership events, sponsorships, legal advocacy and related efforts.More than just the numbers, however, the NRA has developed a reputation in Washington as a political force that can make or break even the strongest politicians. It grades politicians on their votes and directs its resources and those of its membership - both financial and organisational - to supporting its fiercest advocates and defeating staunch opponents. As one former Republican congressman told the New York Times in 2013: ""That was the one group where I said, 'As long as I'm in office, I'm not bucking the NRA.'""Could it change? Gun-control groups, backed by wealthy benefactors like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have become more organised in recent years, attempting to match the NRA's political might. As long as pro-gun groups keep racking up the legislative and electoral wins, however, they'll still be king of the hill.Most recent attempts to pass new federal laws regulating firearms are over before they ever really begin, stymied in the US House of Representatives, which has been in Republican hands since 2011. In June 2016 a group of Democratic politicians staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to protest the Republican House leadership's decision not to hold a vote on two gun-control bills. The House tends to have a pro-gun-rights tilt for the same reason it has recently tended toward the Republican Party in numbers larger than the pure national congressional vote total would indicate. Due to the way the lines of House congressional districts are drawn, many by Republican-controlled state legislatures, there are more ""safe"" seats for Republicans than there are for Democrats. In these congressional districts, the politicians are more responsive to their primary voters, who tend to be motivated by hot-button issues like gun rights. The price for crossing these voters is much higher than alienating those who, while perhaps more in favour of gun control, do not vote in Republican primaries.Demographics also play a part in the pro-gun sentiment in the House, as there are more rural districts with higher levels of gun ownership than there are urban ones. Racking up big pro-gun-control majorities in urban areas does little to change this political reality in the House.Could it change? Unless there's a flood of big-city liberals itching for the country life, demographics will be what they are. There have been some efforts to crack down on overly partisan gerrymandering, however. Barack Obama has made it one of his post-presidency goals, and the Supreme Court is currently considering a legal challenge to Wisconsin legislative districts that give a distinct advantage to Republicans. Getting politics fully out of line-drawing will be a tall task, however.If a gun-control bill were to make it out of the House of Representatives, it would still face a challenge in the Senate, where the rural-urban divide plays itself out on the state level, as well. States dominated by big-city voters, such as New York, Massachusetts or California, are outnumbered by rural and Southern states with pro-gun sentiments.The rules of the Senate can also thwart efforts to enact more stringent firearm regulation, thanks to the ""filibuster"" - a procedural hurdle that means most major pieces of legislation need the backing of 60 out of 100 senators to pass, rather than a simple 51-vote majority. In 2013, following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, it appeared that efforts to strengthen gun-purchase background checks had significant bipartisan support in the Senate. After a concerted lobbying effort by the NRA, however, the bill received only 56 votes in favour, four short of the mark necessary to break the filibuster. No gun-control measure has come close to passage since then.Could it change? Mr Trump has been perhaps the most vocal proponent of doing away with the Senate filibuster, as he views it as an obstacle to enacting his legislative agenda. A majority of senators are on the record against changing the rules, however.With Congress more interested in rolling back existing firearm regulations than implementing new ones, left-leaning US states have taken a greater role in implementing gun-control measures. After the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 21 states passed new gun laws, including imposing assault weapons bans in Connecticut, Maryland and New York.Some of the laws have run up against another barrier, however - the US judicial system. In recent years the Supreme Court has twice ruled that the right to own personal weapons such as handguns is enshrined in the constitution.The Second Amendment says that ""a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed"".Gun-control activists point to the introductory clause as evidence that the amendment was meant primarily to create a ""well regulated"" militia. In 2008, however, a sharply divided court held that the Second Amendment provides a broad right to firearm ownership that prohibits stringent registration requirement for personal weapons.Since then, lower courts have considered challenges to state-imposed assault weapon bans, registration requirements and open-carry prohibitions. So far the Supreme Court has declined to hear any of the new cases, however. Could it change? Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch has made it clear he views Second Amendment rights broadly. The president is filling out the ranks of the lower courts with pro-gun-rights judges. If anything, the judiciary is moving to the right on this issue.Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to new gun-control laws at the national level is that opponents tend to hold fiercely to their beliefs, while support for new regulation tends to ebb and flow around each new instance of violence.The NRA's strategy, and that of pro-gun politicians, is to wait out the storm - to delay legislative efforts until attention turns elsewhere and the outcry fades.Pro-gun politicians offer their thoughts and prayers, observe moments of silence and order flags flown half-staff. Then, in the quiet, legislative efforts are deferred and ultimately derailed.On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters ""there's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country"".Mr Trump, in comments as he left the White House for Puerto Rico, said ""we will be talking about gun laws as time goes by"".As time goes by. As that song from the film Casablanca says, it's still the same old story.Could it change? According to one poll during the 2016 presidential campaign, guns were an important issue for both Democrats and Republicans. That could be a reflection of that year's record-setting mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub or the first indication of a new trend. Follow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter."
"The US is withdrawing more than half of its staff at its embassy in Cuba in response to mysterious attacks which left its diplomats unwell. Washington is also warning Americans not to visit the country because some attacks occurred in hotels.At least 21 staff reported health problems ranging from mild brain trauma and deafness to dizziness and nausea. Describing the US decision as ""hasty"", Cuba said it would affect bilateral ties but co-operation would continue.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the two countries would continue to co-operate in investigating the attacks and said diplomatic ties would be maintained.  Earlier reports suggested that sonic attacks were to blame. Cuba denies any involvement.At least two Canadians were also affected.The US is ordering all non-essential staff in the embassy in Havana to leave, along with all family members. Only ""emergency personnel"" will remain.The US has suspended visa processing in Cuba indefinitely.""Until the government of Cuba can ensure safety of our people, we will be reduced to emergency personnel,"" a US state department official said. ""At least 21 employees have been targeted in specific attacks,"" the official said.Despite an investigation involving the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Cuban authorities, there is still no full explanation as to the cause of the incidents since late 2016.""We don't know the means, the methods or how the attacks are being carried out,"" the official said on Friday. But earlier reports suggested they were sonic attacks in which staff in Havana were targeted by audio waves, leaving several with chronic hearing issues.Using an inaudible sound device for a stealth attack ""is quite plausible from a technical point of view"", Denis Bedat, a specialist in bio-electromagnetics, told AFP news agency this week. ""Ultrasonic waves, beyond the acoustic capacity of humans, can be broadcast with an amplifier, and the device does not need to be large, or used inside or outside a house.""He gave as an example the Active Denial System (ADS), an anti-riot gun used by US police forces that emits electromagnetic waves which produce a sudden unbearable burning sensation.The US has not blamed Cuba for the suspected attacks. Both the US and Cuban governments ""have not yet identified the guilty party"", the state department official said.""We have not ruled out the possibility of a third country as a part of the investigation but that investigation continues,"" the official added. President Raul Castro had reportedly given his personal assurance to the then-US charge d'affaires in Havana that Cuba was not behind the attacks.The US reopened its embassy in Havana in 2015 following decades of frozen relations.In 2016 President Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.In June President Donald Trump announced a partial roll-back of Mr Obama's Cuba policies but said he would not close the US embassy in Havana.One resident of Havana, Andres Murci, told Reuters news agency: ""With the new Trump administration, everything has been lost, everything has gone backwards. We are turning back to the same thing we had before. Everything we advanced with Obama has now turned back."" "
"""Only one thing will work"" in dealing with North Korea after years of talks with Pyongyang brought no results, US President Donald Trump has warned.""Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years,"" he tweeted, adding that this ""hasn't worked"".Mr Trump did not elaborate further. The two nations have been engaged in heated rhetoric over North Korea's nuclear activities, with the US pressing for a halt of missile tests.Pyongyang says it has recently successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb which could be loaded on to a long-range missile.President Trump has previously warned that the US could destroy North Korea if necessary to protect America's national interests and defend its allies in the region.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Saturday praised nuclear weapons as a ""powerful deterrent"" which guaranteed his country's security, state media reported.In a speech addressing ""the complicated international situation"", he said such weapons had safeguarded ""the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and north-east Asia"" against the ""protracted nuclear threats of the US imperialists"".He said his country's policy of simultaneously pursuing the development of nuclear weapons in parallel with moves to strengthen the economy was ""absolutely right"".North Korea recently launched two missiles over Japan and defied international condemnation to carry out its sixth nuclear test in September.  It has promised to carry out another test in the Pacific Ocean.There are fears in the West that is rapidly reaching the point where it is capable of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the US mainland.Saturday's tweets by President Trump are another cryptic announcement by America's leader, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington says.Last week, it was suggested that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had direct lines of communication with Pyongyang to try to resolve the escalating tensions. Mr Trump then tweeted: ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!""On Saturday, the US president insisted he had a good relationship with his secretary of state, but added that Mr Tillerson could be tougher.Earlier in the week, Mr Tillerson had denied rumours of a rift between the two men, amid media reports he had called the president a ""moron"".Mr Trump's latest comment on North Korea could just be bluster - but the fear is that Pyongyang will interpret it as a threat, our correspondent says.At a speech to the UN later that month, Mr Trump threatened to annihilate North Korea, saying the country's leader, Kim Jong-un,"" is on a suicide mission"".In exchange, Mr Kim in a rare statement, vowed to ""tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire"".Daily life goes on in world's most secretive capital"
" The US has expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, saying Havana failed to protect US diplomats from mysterious acoustic attacks.Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez called the move ""unacceptable"". The Department of State move follows last week's US withdrawal of more than half of its own diplomats from the Cuban capital.Nearly two dozen US personnel have suffered unexplained ill health in the city.""The decision was made due to Cuba's failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention. This order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations,"" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement on Tuesday. The Cuban diplomats have been given seven days to leave.Mr Rodriguez said the move was ""unjustified"".At least 21 people working at the US's embassy in Cuba have reported health problems, ranging from mild brain trauma and deafness to dizziness and nausea.Earlier reports suggested sonic attacks were to blame, but nothing has been proven.  Cuba denies targeting embassy staff, and the US has not blamed the country's government for the suspected attacks.By Will Grant, BBC News, Havana The Cuban response to the Trump Administration's decision to expel two-thirds of its diplomatic staff from Washington was predictably outraged. The US had been ""irresponsible"" and ""hasty"" the island's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said, insisting that the State Department hadn't provided ""a shred of evidence"" as to the harm caused to US diplomats in the alleged attacks.Cuban doctors had not had any access to either the victims or the US medical staff attending to them, Mr Rodriuguez added. Cuba-US relations are at a low ebb once again, almost completely erasing all the goodwill built up over the Obama presidency in a matter of months. Millions of Cuban families are caught in the middle with visas for Cuban visitors to the United States suspended. The only glimmer of hope is that relations haven't been broken altogether and that the Cubans reiterated their willingness to work with the Americans to find a solution.""We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to co-operate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,"" Mr Tillerson added in his latest statement.Last week US officials said: ""We don't know the means, the methods or how the attacks are being carried out."""
"US Vice-President Mike Pence has walked out of a National Football League (NFL) game after several players refused to stand for the US national anthem.Mr Pence said he could not be present at an event that ""disrespects our soldiers, our flag"" after abandoning the game in his home state of Indiana.President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked Mr Pence to leave if players kneeled and said he was ""proud of him"".Kneeling at NFL games has become a form of protest against racial injustice.Mr Trump has criticised players sharply for the protests and pressed the NFL to ban them.""I left today's Colts game because @POTUS [President Trump] and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our National Anthem,"" Mr Pence tweeted on Sunday.By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, WashingtonMike Pence travelled quite a ways - from Nevada to Indianapolis then back west to California - to make a statement.There's little doubt the vice-president, despite his earlier tweet about looking forward to attending an NFL game in his home state, planned to walk out early. The matchup involved the San Francisco 49ers, whose then-quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, started the kneeling protests. Mr Pence's media pool was told the vice-president might be making a quick exit. And Mr Pence's press statement, followed by a presidential tweet of approval, appeared shortly after Mr Pence left.Next come the questions. Was that statement worth the vice-president's time? And how much did that trip cost US taxpayers? Trump's supporters are already celebrating the move, helping the vice-president burnish his standing with his boss's loyal base. Some of the NFL players were clearly irritated by what they saw as a political publicity stunt. Americans, according to polls, are split. They're not happy about the NFL protests, but they don't like Mr Trump's eagerness to stoke the flames of controversy. Now - as tensions rise in North Korea and yet another hurricane slams into the US - Mr Pence is joining the anthem fray. Mr Pence's departure came after players from the visiting San Francisco 49ers did not stand during the anthem before the game against the Indianapolis Colts.""While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag,"" Mr Pence added.He had earlier tweeted that he and his wife Karen were looking forward to the game in a tweet in which he used of photo of then both wearing Colts shirts. That the photo appeared also to have been used in 2014 has in part helped fuel critics' claims his walk out was a publicity stunt.His team won the game 26-23.Mr Trump has previously said that his comments condemning the NFL protests have ""nothing to do with race"".But his criticism of the protests has appeared to galvanise players,Recent protests have involved players kneeling, linking arms or staying in the locker room during the Star-Spangled Banner.San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stirred controversy last year when he first knelt for the anthem to highlight the treatment of black Americans after a series of police shootings.Since then, more and more public figures in the US have been ""taking a knee"" at big events and using the hashtag #TakeAKnee on social media."
"Equifax has revealed 2.5 million more Americans than previously thought may have had information compromised in a huge cyber security breach at the firm. The credit report giant said on Monday about 145.5 million of its US customers might have been affected, up from a previous estimate of 143 million. The update came a day before former boss Richard Smith testifies in Congress about the attack.Mr Smith apologised ahead of the hearing for the firm's failings.Critics say the company failed to take proper steps to guard information - such as Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses - and waited too long to inform the public.Equifax disclosed the attack last month, estimating that about 400,000 Britons and 100,000 Canadians may also have had data compromised.On Monday, the firm raised its estimate for US customers, but lowered it to only 8,000 Canadians after further investigation.In remarks prepared for Congress, which were published on Monday, Mr Smith urged the US to adopt new standards for customer credit information.Mr Smith, who resigned last month, said the attack made him believe consumers should have sole control over when their credit information may be accessed. The testimony from Equifax's former chief executive and chairman also offered a chronology of the incident.Mr Smith said the first attack happened in May, with hackers taking advantage of a software vulnerability that Equifax was warned about in March but did not fix.Equifax identified an intrusion on July 29. Mr Smith said he learned about the problem two days later.An investigation ordered by the company revealed the enormity of the attack by mid-August. Mr Smith said Equifax faced a ""massive"" task to prepare to respond to customers. Even so, the firm was overwhelmed by calls after the breach became public, and faced problems with the website it created to address customer complaints.Equifax holds data on more than 820 million consumers as well as information on 91 million businesses."
"US President Donald Trump has expanded his controversial travel ban to include people from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad, citing security concerns.The new, open-ended restrictions follow a review of information sharing by other countries, the White House said.Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia remain under the travel ban. Sanctions previously placed on Sudan were lifted.In a presidential proclamation, Mr Trump said the countries in the list had ""inadequate"" security protocols.""I must act to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people,"" he said in the document, issued late on Sunday.According to data available from the US State Department, 109 visas were issued to North Korean citizens in 2016, however, it is unclear how many actually travelled to the United States.Mr Trump's original ban in March was highly controversial, as it affected six majority-Muslim countries, and was widely labelled a ""Muslim ban"".It was subject to a range of legal challenges and several large-scale protests, and was due to be considered by the US Supreme Court on 10 October, having been partly reinstated in July.But on Monday the Supreme Court postponed the October oral arguments, and instead called upon all parties challenging the White House to resubmit briefs to the court on whether the case should be dismissed.The American Civil Liberties Union rights group said the addition of the new countries did not ""obfuscate the real fact that the administration's order is still a Muslim ban"".The addition of North Korea and Venezuela now means not all nations on the list are majority-Muslim. The restrictions on Venezuelans apply only to government officials and their family members.The Venezuelan foreign ministry on Monday described the new restriction as ""a form of psychological and political terrorism"".The criteria for the new ban list are now based on vetting procedures and co-operation, and the restrictions have been ""tailored"" on a country-by-country basis:Most of the restrictions come in the form of suspension of B-1 and B-2 business and tourist visas, and are not time-limited in the way that Mr Trump's former executive order was.In a fact sheet accompanying Mr Trump's proclamation, the White House said that while Iraq also fell short of the required criteria, the country was not included in the new restrictions ""because of the close co-operative relationship between the United States"" and their part in fighting so-called Islamic State.The restrictions come into effect on 18 October, but will not apply to those already in possession of a valid visa, the White House said."
"An estimated 10 million people in the US saw Facebook adverts bought in Russia before and after the US presidential election.The company published the numbers in a blog post as it turned over 3,000 Russian-bought ads to federal investigators on Monday. It said most ads focused on ""divisive social and political messages"" on issues like immigration and gun rights.Russia has denied trying to influence the election. Elliot Schrage, vice-president of policy and communications at Facebook, said the company is ""continuing to refine our techniques for identifying the kinds of ads in question"".In an earlier post on the company's blog on Monday, Facebook's vice president of global public policy Joel Kaplan announced that it would also be adding 1,000 people to its global ads review team. The ads violated Facebook's policies because they came from inauthentic accounts. Facebook said that many did not violate its content policies. The tech giant used modelling to estimate the number of users who had seen the Russian-bought ads, which it said appear to have come from a Russian entity called the Internet Research Agency. It said that 44% of the ads surfaced before the US election."
"Mention Nottingham in a conversation and for many people the first thing that comes to mind is Robin Hood.I've had the Disney movie song ""Robin Hood and Little John walking through the forest…"" stuck in my head since visiting the city.But the story being told here today is very different from the fable of old.Instead of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, it's students hoping to get rich who are flocking to this city two hours north of London.Nottingham Business School - which is part of Nottingham Trent University - has seen a 25% rise in interest from international students this year.That's believed to be partially due to an unlikely source: Donald Trump.While many Americans might have voted for the president partly because they valued his business acumen, an unlikely casualty of his immigration policies is said to be American business schools.""One of the things we noticed post the [presidential] election in the US last November was a change in students' expressed intent to study in the US,"" says Sangeet Chowfla, the president and chief executive of the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC).The GMAC is the non-profit organisation that administers the GMAT, a standardised test most students around the world take to get into business school.It published a survey of 1,000 global business schools this month, which found that international student interest in American business schools had declined by nearly two-thirds since the 2016 presidential election.Meanwhile, international student interest in programs in Canada, for example, has increased by nearly the same amount. The same goes for programs in continental Europe and the UK.While that trend has been happening for some time, Mr Chowfla says he was surprised by the steep drop.""The magnitude of the change was exaggerated this year,"" he says.Part of the decline was due to student concerns about immigration policies - most notably, the ability to get an H1B visa after graduating.The H1B is typically given to ""skilled"" immigrants to the US, like computer programmers, and 85,000 visas are awarded each year via a lottery system.It is often used by companies in Silicon Valley to bring in tech talent - but it has also been used by outsourcing companies.Critics, including President Trump, have said those companies use the program to hire foreign workers instead of Americans - and he's proposed reforming it.That's scared international students, particularly those pursuing business degrees, who use the programs as stepping stones to better or more well-paid careers.While the number of foreign business students in the US may be declining, for many American students, business remains a global enterprise. Monica Kelly is one of those students. Though she hails from Seattle, Washington, she's spent most of her career in Los Angeles.""I was in a position where I reached senior management level and I was looking for a way to expand my global opportunities,"" she says.Monica decided that in order to seize those opportunities, she had to go abroad for business school. That's how she found herself at Nottingham.And she's not alone.At Nottingham, I spoke with two other students from India, and the program boasts a class made up of people from 104 countries.Almost all of them said business was an increasingly global endeavour. Because of that, they fretted they wouldn't be able to get international experience in the US, a country they feel has increasingly turned inwards.That they're attracted to a business school in the UK, however, is no accident.""In the UK, we have gone through a period where the MBA [the main business school qualification] suffered quite a bit,"" says Baback Yazdani, the dean of Nottingham Business School.That was partially due to visa restrictions that were put in place five years ago, which limited the ability for graduate students to get post-study work visas.Since then, Nottingham has worked hard to build its program around ""experiential learning"" - meaning that in addition to traditional classes, students travel abroad to work for companies in places like Italy and Rome. The school also focused on helping students secure internships at companies that might sponsor them for visas, or that might be able to hire them in other parts of the world. Businesses close to Nottingham include Boots, which has merged with the pharmacy chain Walgreens in the US.""Overall the MBAs are a saturated market - and it's a global market,"" says Mr Yazdani. ""There are very sophisticated consumers for this market. So they know what they want and they know it's everywhere. So they are looking for differentiators and value.""Speaking of value - at an annual price of £16,500, or around $22,000 at today's exchange rates - the Nottingham program is under half what most students at US business schools end up paying per year.Today, there are more than 5,000 students in its various business degree courses.Nottingham's administration says that their pivot could possibly help US schools.""My guess is that's probably happening now in the [US], and that the universities [there] will be going through the same trajectories,"" says Nottingham Business School lecturer Phil Considine.""We're kind of five years ahead of them.""In Nottingham's atrium, banners are strung from the rafters welcoming international students, who start classes today.Looking out through the school's windows, you can see the beginning of the famed Sherwood Forest - where story has it Robin Hood hid out with his merry men. For US business schools, who might not be feeling too merry, ""stealing"" a lesson from Nottingham might be a good way to make it through leaner times."
"US Health Secretary Tom Price has apologised over his private plane trips on official government business.The former Georgia congressman said he will reimburse taxpayers and fly commercial in future.His apology comes a day after US President Donald Trump said he was ""not happy"" with Mr Price's trips.Government officials, except those dealing with national security matters, are required to take commercial flights for work-related travel.An investigation by Politico found Mr Price had taken at least 24 such flights since early May at a cost to taxpayers of $300,000 (£223,000).""To make sure everyone knows that this will never happen again, I am taking the following steps,"" said Mr Price in a statement on Thursday.He said he would continue to co-operate with a review into the matter by his Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) inspector general. ""I will take no more private charter flights as Secretary of HHS,"" he added. ""No exceptions.""Today, I will write a personal check to the US Treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes. The taxpayers won't pay a dime for my seat on those planes.""Two other members of Mr Trump's cabinet are under scrutiny by inspectors general for their use of private planes while on the job: When asked if he would fire the Health and Human Services Secretary over his trips, Mr Trump said on Wednesday: ""We'll see."" Mr Price's flights have included travelling from Washington DC to Nashville for the afternoon, where he spent less than 90 minutes at two scheduled events and had lunch with his son, who lives in the Tennessee city. The Learjet round-trip cost nearly $18,000 of taxpayers' money, according to Politico. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a letter on Wednesday asking Mr Price about his use of ""government-owned aircraft for personal travel or private non-commercial aircraft for official travel"". The committee gave Mr Price two weeks to hand over the records. Tesia D Williams, a spokeswoman for the HHS inspector general, told the BBC the agency is reviewing whether it was ""potentially inappropriate travel"". "
"US President Donald Trump is planning to abandon the Iran nuclear deal shortly, according to US media reports.If he fails to certify the accord, Congress will decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on Iran. Mr Trump has until 15 October to decide.  Opposition to the deal was a major part of his campaign last year.Posing for photographers with military leaders on Thursday, he said this was ""the calm before the storm"" but refused to give further details.There was speculation his comments might refer to heightened tensions with North Korea, but the New York Times says ""people who have been briefed on the matter"" believe he means Iran.Mr Trump was seen at the White House with his wife Melania, as well as military leaders, after Thursday's meetings but before dinner together. Gesturing at the people around him, he asked the waiting press if they knew ""what this represents"".""Maybe it's the calm before the storm,"" he said.When reporters pressed him on what storm he was referring to, he would only say: ""You'll find out."" He had earlier told his top defence officials he expected them to provide ""a broad range of military options... at a much faster pace"" in future.US media say the president will announce next Thursday that he will not be certifying the deal on the grounds it does not serve US security interests. But some of his top advisers, such as Defence Secretary James Mattis, appear to back the deal.The presidency must certify the deal every 90 days; Mr Trump has already done so twice.If he rejected it this time, Congress would have 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Iran. US media reports suggest they are likely to leave the deal in place.Speaking in the White House's Cabinet Room, President Trump said: ""The Iranian regime supports terrorism and exports violence and chaos across the Middle East.""That is why we must put an end to Iran's continued aggression and nuclear ambitions. You will be hearing about Iran very shortly.""In reaction, Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said the deal was not renegotiable, reported Iran's Press TV. But he suggested it might be salvageable if the other partners - France, Germany, China, Russia and the UK - remained on board. If not, he said, the deal will ""definitely fall apart"".Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he hoped ""the final decision reached by the US president will be balanced and will be based on the present-day realities"", reported Interfax news agency.Analysis by the BBC's Anthony ZurcherOnce again the president appears poised to hand a tough issue over to Congress to deal with. In July Mr Trump ended an Obama-era programme offering normalised immigration status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children - and gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative solution.They're still working on that one, sort of, and now Congress has another tricky situation to resolve while the clock is ticking. There's plenty of sentiment among Republicans to impose stringent new sanctions on the Iranian regime. The risks, however, of tearing up a multinational deal that international relations experts say has helped keep Iranian nuclear ambitions in check is great.As with healthcare, another issue the White House has given Congress little guidance on, legislators will have to decide between their at-times overheated campaign promises and more practical concerns. Given that inertia is on the side of inaction, the Iranian nuclear deal - though weakened by the president's sabre-rattling - may hold together. One thing is certain, however. The president's decision would inject new levels of acrimony into US-Iranian relations and again put a blazing spotlight on congressional politicians who are already anxiously eying their re-election campaigns in 2018.The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon, with the president's administration having to certify to Congress that Iran is upholding its part of the deal every 90 days.It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil. The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must restrict its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years, and allow inspectors in to the country.Mr Trump has repeatedly said Iran has broken the ""spirit"" of the deal.In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Trump called the deal, which was brokered while his predecessor Barack Obama was in power, ""an embarrassment to the United States""."
"The US government has announced the start of construction on eight prototype barriers for the border with Mexico, a campaign promise of President Donald Trump.The Customs and Border Protection says four of the prototypes will be made from concrete, while the others are from ""alternate or other materials"".Its plan is to try out several sections of wall near San Diego.Mr Trump had promised to build a ""big beautiful wall"" between the countries.With a heavy federal and local law enforcement presence, workers have broken ground in an area surrounded by chain link fencing at Otay Mesa, one of three ports of entry in the San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan region.The prototypes will be up to 30ft (9m) high and 30ft long and are expected to be completed within 30 days.Officials will then spend up to three months evaluating the designs for their effectiveness, including gauging their resistance to penetration with small hand tools. Cameras and sensors will be incorporated into the final wall plan.  Each wall will cost up to $450,000 (£334,000) and will be paid for by federal funds which have already been sanctioned. There is, however, no agreement on the initial $1.5bn (£1.11bn) Mr Trump has requested from Congress to start construction of the final wall.During his campaign, Mr Trump insisted that Mexico would pay for the structure.""We are committed to securing our border and that includes constructing border walls,"" said Ronald Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection agency.""Our multi-pronged strategy to ensure the safety and security of the American people includes barriers, infrastructure, technology and people."" Four companies have been chosen to build the prototypes but the final wall is likely to be based on an amalgamation of design features.The border agency says the prototypes ""will inform future design standards which will likely continue to evolve to meet the US Border Patrol's requirements"".Mr Trump has said some sections of the wall could be transparent so that people on the US side cannot be hit by bags of drugs being tossed over from Mexico. He has also suggested that parts of the wall could be covered in solar panels.But California's attorney general is attempting to block the construction of a border wall. A lawsuit filed in a federal district court in San Diego last week argues that the government has overstepped its authority by waiving environmental reviews and other laws."
"US President Donald Trump has told the UN General Assembly that America would destroy North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.In his debut speech, he mocked North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission.""North Korea has tested nuclear bombs and missiles in defiance of the UN.Just before Mr Trump spoke, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had urged statesmanship, saying: ""We must not sleepwalk our way into war.""  The American leader also attacked Iran, saying it was a ""corrupt dictatorship"" intent on destabilising the Middle East. He called on the government in Tehran to cease supporting terrorism and again criticised the Obama-era international agreement over Iran's nuclear programme, which he called an embarrassment. In his own debut speech, French President Emmanuel Macron strongly defended the Paris climate accord, signed in the same room in New York two years ago and rejected in June by Mr Trump, to widespread international dismay.The General Assembly, which continues until Monday, is an annual event, bringing together leaders of the UN's 193 member states.Key messages from Trump's speechReality Check: Has UN staffing doubled since 2000?In other parts of Mr Trump's speech he:Washington has repeatedly warned North Korea over its weapons tests, which violate UN Security Council resolutions. The crisis worsened last month when the North announced plans to test missiles around the US Pacific territory of Guam. ""If [the US] is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump's threat to ""totally destroy"" North Korea is implausible, according to Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York think tank.""I think the folks in the Pentagon when they look at military options are just aghast at the potential loss of life that could occur with at a minimum hundreds of thousands of South Koreans killed in Seoul,"" he told the BBC.  Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea?President Trump's speech was an eloquent exposition of his ""America First"" doctrine but at the same time contained some fulsome (and perhaps unexpected) praise for the United Nations as a body that can bring together sovereign states to tackle the world's problems. In contrast to the focus on globalisation that has driven so much of foreign policy discussion since the 1990s, Mr Trump saw national sovereignty as the main pillar of the international system. There was a nod to the old axis of evil theme. He opposed ""the righteous many"" to ""the wicked few"", with his rogues' gallery taking in a predictable cast of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela. Nonetheless Mr Trump's world view contained many contradictions. Where exactly is the boundary between national sovereignty and collective action? And does America's newfound foreign policy pragmatism extend just to calling for the return of democracy in Iran and Venezuela or actually for doing something practical about it?The 2015 deal between Iran, the US and other world powers, including China and Russia, was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon.""Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it,"" Mr Trump told the General Assembly on Tuesday.Iran's government, he said, was bent on ""death and destruction"", while its people wanted change.Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif commented on Twitter that ""Trump's ignorant hate speech"" belonged ""in medieval times - not the 21st Century UN"".Trump's ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times-not the 21st Century UN -unworthy of a reply. Fake empathy for Iranians fools no one.End of Twitter post  by @JZarifUsing almost biblical language, the American leader portrayed the world in terms of ""decent nations"" confronted with ""rogue regimes"".""If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few then evil will triumph,"" he said in the speech. ""When decent people and nations become bystanders to history the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.""The General Assembly was opened by Mr Guterres, who said that millions of people were living in dread as a result of North Korea's nuclear and missile tests.""The use of nuclear weapons should be unthinkable,"" he said. ""But today global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at the highest level since the end of the Cold War.""The former head of the UN refugee agency also spoke of being ""pained to see the way refugees and migrants have been stereotyped and scapegoated - and to see political figures stoke resentment in search of electoral gain"".According to Reuters news agency, when Mr Trump made his remarks about destroying North Korea, one man in the audience covered his face with his hands, while Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom crossed her arms. Loud, startled murmurs filled the hall, according to the agency.In his speech, President Macron said climate change was starting to take revenge on man, and extreme weather events would erase the differences between rich and poor countries.  He promised an extra €5bn ($6bn; £4.4bn) of French investment to fight climate change.The French leader also defended the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Renouncing it would be a grave error,"" he said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sided with Mr Trump in his speech, saying the deal with Iran should be amended or scrapped altogether, and warned against the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used his speech to urge the Iraqi government to stop the  Kurdistan Regional Government holding a referendum on independence on 25 September."
"An internal investigation has been opened into Health Secretary Tom Price over his private plane travel on official government business.A spokesman for the agency's inspector general told the BBC ""we take this matter very seriously"". The probe follows a demand from Democrats.Mr Price's spokesperson has defended his use of charter planes, saying they are necessary for ""official business"".It comes amid an inquiry into another Trump official's mode of air travel.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin - a former Goldman Sachs banker - is already under investigation by his agency's own inspector general.The watchdog is seeking to determine whether Mr Mnuchin improperly used a US government jet to view the solar eclipse with his wife last month.An investigation by Politico found this week that Mr Price, a former Georgia congressman, had taken 24 flights on private chartered planes since May, at a cost to taxpayers of around $300,000 (£220,000).Government officials, with the exception of those dealing directly with national security matters, are required to take commercial flights for work-related travel.Tesia D Williams, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) inspector general's office, told the BBC on Friday their review ""focuses on whether the travel complied with Federal Travel Regulations, but may encompass other issues related to the travel"".""We take this matter very seriously, and when questions arose about potentially inappropriate travel, we immediately began assessing the issue."" Politico, a Washington DC political news outlet, documented one flight taken by Mr Price from Philadelphia to Washington, which cost about $25,000 - a trip that would typically cost around $300 to fly commercial.Late on Wednesday, five Democratic lawmakers wrote to the inspector general of Mr Price's agency, demanding an inquiry into his use of luxury private jets, several of which included leather chairs, a kitchen and wi-fi internet.""American taxpayers deserve assurances that their tax dollars are not wasted by the government's highest officials,"" the lawmakers wrote.Charmaine Yoest, a spokesperson for HHS, defended the cabinet secretary's flights, saying they were needed ""in order to accommodate his demanding schedule"".""Some believe the HHS Secretary should be Washington-focused. Dr Price is focused on hearing from Americans across the country,"" she said in a statement.She later told the Washington Post: ""This is Secretary Price, getting outside of DC, making sure he is connected with the real American people.""Mr Price, an orthopaedic physician, has been tasked by US President Donald Trump with directing the Republican plan to repeal Obamacare.In June, Mr Price attended a physicians' conference where he vowed to end wasteful government spending.The private plane which he took to that event, the first stop on a five-state tour, cost $50,420, according to Politico.Meanwhile, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos - who is the second wealthiest Trump cabinet official - told the Associated Press news agency this week she uses her ""personally-owned aircraft"" for travel at zero cost to taxpayers.""Secretary DeVos accepted her position to serve the public and is fully committed to being a faithful steward of taxpayer dollars"", her spokeswoman said.She added that she ""neither seeks, nor accepts, any reimbursement for her flights, nor for any additional official travel-related expenses""."
"The US should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal, Defence Secretary James Mattis has suggested.Asked in a Senate hearing whether he thought this was in the national interest, he said that it was.President Donald Trump, who is highly critical of the deal, is to decide by 15 October whether Iran is complying. The White House has not commented on the defence secretary's remarks.The 2015 accord was designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon.""I believe at this point in time, absent indications to the contrary, it is something that the president should consider staying with,"" Mr Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington.""If we can confirm that Iran is living by the agreement, if we can determine that this is in our best interest, then clearly we should stay with it,"" he added.Last month, President Trump said Iran was keeping to the spirit of the agreement ""atrociously"".He also described the agreement - signed by Iran, the US, the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - as the ""one of the worst deals I've seen"".In April, Mr Trump ordered a review into whether a suspension of sanctions on Iran, linked to the deal curbing its nuclear activities, was in the US national interest.If the US president does not recertify by the set deadline that Tehran is complying with the agreement, he could withdraw his approval. Congress would then have 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Iran suspended under the deal.Iran has always said it has the right to nuclear energy - and insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.The International Atomic Energy Agency said last month that Iran was implementing the nuclear-related commitments from the deal."
"Venezuela has accused the US of ""psychological terrorism"" after it imposed travel restrictions on some Venezuelan government officials and their families. The foreign ministry said travel bans like the one announced on Sunday were incompatible with international law.The ban on eight countries includes Venezuela for the first time. US President Donald Trump said the countries on the list had ""inadequate"" security protocols.Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen are all now subject to US travel bans.  In regards to Venezuela, President Trump said its government had failed to share ""public-safety and terrorism-related information adequately"".""I must act to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people,"" he said in a presidential proclamation issued on Sunday.The statement by the Venezuelan foreign minister [in Spanish] called the decision ""irrational"".Venezuela and the US have had tense relations for years.They have further deteriorated in the past months as the US imposed sanctions on more than a dozen top Venezuelan officials, including President Nicolás Maduro over what it called Venezuela's ""democratic failures"".Any assets they held in the US were frozen and US entities were banned from doing business with them.US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called President Maduro ""a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people"",The US is not the only country to have imposed sanctions on Venezuela.Last week,  Canada published a list of 40 Venezuelan officials whose assets it said it would freeze.The Venezuelan government has also been criticised by many of its Latin American neighbours as well as the European Union for going ahead with a controversial constituent assembly.

"Imports of solar panels have harmed US manufacturers, the US International Trade Commission ruled on Friday.The decision was a win for the two US-based producers that brought the case, saying their business had been hurt by a flood of foreign products.President Donald Trump will decide on potential remedies for the industry.The case is controversial, as US firms that install and assemble panels worry that more expensive products could slow the industry's growth.The commission has several more weeks to make a recommendation for how President Trump should proceed. A remedy, which could include tariffs or quotas, has not been decided.Mr Trump has made America First a signature part of his trade policy, speaking in favour of greater protections for US companies and jobs.The case was brought by Suniva and SolarWorld Americas, which are majority-owned by overseas businesses and face financial troubles. They say more than two dozen US solar panel manufacturing operations have stopped in recent years as imports surged.Attorney Timothy Brightbill, who represented SolarWorld, called the decision a ""win for American manufacturing"" and the solar industry.SolarWorld employs about 300 people in Oregon, down from 1,300 at the peak, but the firm is hopeful this decision will help the business return to growth, he said.""In order to have a strong solar industry, we need to have manufacturing in America as a key component,"" he said. The US solar industry employs about 260,000 people, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.  The organisation's president and chief executive, Abigail Ross Hopper, said the trade commission's decision was ""disappointing"".She criticised the tariffs proposed by Suniva as relief, arguing that they would increase prices and drive many other solar energy companies out of business.The US has already imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels, which led to increased imports from other countries. A remedy in this case would apply to all countries. ""As the remedy phase moves forward, I am determined to reach a conclusion that will protect the solar industry, our workers and the American public from what amounts to a shakedown by these two companies,"" Ms Hopper said."
"US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis says the US will send 3,000 extra troops to Afghanistan as the Taliban gain ground and security deteriorates.American combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but over 8,000 US special forces remain in the country backing Afghan troops.US President Donald Trump last month signalled he would keep US boots on the ground indefinitely.The Taliban pledged to turn Afghanistan into a ""graveyard"" for foreign forces.Mr Mattis confirmed the deployment on Monday, speaking to reporters at the Department of Defense.Read more on Trump's presidency:It follows a request in February from the senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, for several thousand additional troops to help the struggling Afghan security forces.The decision to send more troops to Afghanistan caps a change of heart for Mr Trump on America's longest war.During the Obama administration, he repeatedly called for the US to withdraw from Afghanistan. We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpBut once he became a frontrunner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Mr Trump modified his stance. He said the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan was ""a terrible mistake"", but supported keeping troops in the country to prevent a ""collapse"".Last month he said the US would remain in the country to kill terrorists rather than nation-build.At peak deployment levels in 2011, there were some 100,000 US personnel in the country. Sixteen years after the US-led invasion, the Afghan government still only controls half of the country."
"US President Donald Trump is facing growing condemnation from the sports world after his criticism of players.On Friday, Mr Trump said the National Football League (NFL) should fire players who protest during the US anthem.Top football players have attacked Mr Trump in response. The sport's boss called his comments ""divisive"".Hours before Sunday's games, Mr Trump urged fans to boycott games as a way of making change ""take place fast"".Warning: This article contains language some readers may find offensive.At a rally on Friday night, Mr Trump said NFL players who protested during the playing of the national anthem should be fired by their team. He was referring to a controversial string of protests started by player Colin Kaepernick last year when he sat or kneeled during the anthem to highlight the treatment of black Americans.""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired,"" he told a cheering crowd.Kaepernick led the San Francisco 49ers to the 2013 Super Bowl, but his status in the team has declined since, and he lost his starting place last year.No team has offered him a job as a quarterback - and his supporters say he is being pushed out because of his political action.But others say his status as a ""free agent"" is down to his performance on the field.What have sports stars said to Trump?How the fans see itNFL commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement saying ""divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect"".President Trump, however, doubled down on his comments in a tweet.Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThe NFL Players' Association said the president had crossed a line by effectively telling players to just ""shut up and play"". Association president Eric Winston said Mr Trump's comments were ""a slap in the face to the civil rights heroes of the past and present"".On Saturday night, the Oakland Athletics' Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball player to kneel in protest during the national anthem, mimicking the gesture of protest started by Colin Kaepernick.His father is in the military and he was born on an army base, US media report. He told a reporter he was ""kneeling for people that don't have a voice"".Jed York, CEO of the San Francisco 49ers - Kaepernick's former team - said he would continue to support his players.""The callous and offensive comments made by the President are contradictory to what this great country stands for,"" he said in a statement.There has been no comment from many teams, including New York Jets owner Woody Johnson - a wealthy businessman and Trump campaign donor who was appointed as his ambassador to the UK.Kaepernick's mother, Teresa, also joined in the backlash, referencing Trump's ""son of a bitch"" comment and tweeting: ""Guess that makes me a proud bitch!""Guess that makes me a proud bitch!End of Twitter post  by @B4IleaveUOn Saturday, Mr Trump withdrew an invitation to the White House to basketball champions the Golden State Warriors after one player, Stephen Curry, said he did not want to attend. Curry - NBA's top performer in 2015 - said he wanted to show that he and other players did not stand for ""the things that he's said and the things that he hasn't said in the right times"".""Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team,"" Mr Trump tweeted afterwards. ""Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!""In response, triple NBA champion LeBron James, one of the sport's foremost stars, labelled the President a ""bum"".""Going to White House was an honour until you showed up,"" he said. Retired star Kobe Bryant also tweeted his support.U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!End of Twitter post  by @KingJamesA #POTUS whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred  can't possibly ""Make America Great Again""End of Twitter post  by @kobebryantThe Golden State Warriors, meanwhile, said the team had clearly understood ""that we are not invited"" to the White House but would visit Washington DC on its own ""to celebrate equality, diversity, and inclusion"".NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was disappointed the team would not be visiting the White House but was ""proud"" of the players for speaking out.Separately, 2017 college basketball champions the North Carolina Tar Heels announced they, too,  would not be going to the White House to celebrate their victory, despite being invited. A spokesman said a suitable date that worked for both parties could not be found.Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter, AlabamaDonald Trump spoke for nearly an hour and a half at his rally in Alabama on Friday. The audience of 10,000 was enthusiastic, but one of his biggest applause lines - outside of swipes at North Korea and Hillary Clinton - was when the president took aim at any ""son of a bitch"" in the NFL who protests during the national anthem.The crowd went wild - and the president kept going, lamenting recent rule changes, in response to evidence of devastating brain injuries to players, that seek to punish the most ferocious hits in the game.On Saturday morning the president took to Twitter to fire off line after line attacking the NFL - and athletes in any sport who may have taken issue with his earlier comments.This is a fight Mr Trump relishes. He knows his base will flock to him when he questions the patriotism of wealthy athletes. Lines about tax cuts and healthcare reform on Friday night were duds. No-one cared much when he spoke of striking deals with Democrats. The president knows his audience. And he knows how to change the subject."
"The US is considering closing its embassy in Cuba after diplomatic staff reported health problems which Washington blames on a ""sonic attack"".Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a decision whether to shut to the mission in Havana was ""under evaluation"".More than 20 staff suffered conditions ranging from mild brain trauma and hearing loss to dizziness and nausea. US officials believe some kind of device was used to undermine their health. Cuba denies any involvement.At least two Canadians have been affected by similar symptoms. ""It's a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered,"" Mr Tillerson told CBS.Despite an investigation involving the FBI, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Cuban authorities, there is still no full explanation as to the cause of the incidents since late 2016. President Raul Castro reportedly gave his personal assurance to the then-US Charge d'Affaires in Havana that Cuba was not behind the attacks. The US reopened its embassy in Havana in 2015 following decades of frozen relations.In 2016 President Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.In June President Donald Trump announced a partial roll-back of Mr Obama's Cuba policies, but said he would not close the US embassy in Havana."
"The US Federal Reserve has decided to start running down the stock of financial assets it bought in its quantitative easing scheme.Quantitative easing was a policy that the Fed, and other central banks, used to prevent the recession that followed the financial crisis from becoming an even deeper downturn. It involved buying financial assets with money newly created by the central bank.In the US the assets were bonds or debts issued by the Federal government and by official agencies that support lending to home buyers.One aim of the policy was to reduce the interest rates paid by businesses and households borrowing money. Normally central banks try to do that by using their own interest rate policies, which in the case of the Fed means a target it sets for overnight borrowing between commercial banks, known as the Federal Funds Rate.But when that official rate got to almost zero, as it did in December 2008, the Fed's policy makers thought that it couldn't, or shouldn't go any lower. The Fed's own research suggests that its QE policy has helped reduce long term interest rates.The consequence of all that QE is that the Fed now holds about four and a half trillion dollars of assets. Before it started the programme the figure was less than a quarter of that amount. Assessments of the impact of QE vary, but many economists take the view that it has helped the US economy. Many also fear it has created a new danger of financial market instability.  Share and bond prices are high. Some argue that there is a bubble that could burst and trigger a new financial crisis. The Fed's asset purchases mean there has been more demand for the assets it is buying which tends to push the prices up.In addition, the sellers of those assets need to do something with the money they receive. They may repay debt, but in many cases they buy other assets, often assets with more risk of losing money - such as shares or assets in emerging economies.That in turn tends to push their prices up.  That is what lies behind the concerns about possible financial instability. All the major developed world central banks, apart from Canada's, have used quantitative easing and several are still actively buying financial assets. In the US however, the Fed stopped in 2014. But that doesn't mean that it stopped buying assets at the time.  Bonds are debts which (mostly) have a repayment or maturity date when the holder receives the face value of the bond from the borrower or issuer of the bond. The debt is in effect repaid to whoever owns the bond on the date it matures. In the case of US government bond, it's the Treasury that would repay the central bank. So far, the Fed has used the proceeds of these repayments to buy more bonds in the financial markets keeping its holdings roughly constant. Now it is going to reduce the amount that it 'reinvests' in that way. So over time, as more bonds mature its holdings of them will decline. It also means that over time the extra money it created in the first place to buy the bonds will decline. As an aside it's worth emphasising that the newly created money is not something that can be spent on goods and services.It is money called reserves, which is held in accounts owned by commercial banks at the central bank. It's used for transactions between banks and is an important part of the financial and monetary system.But other types of business and households can't use this type of money. Having said that, adding to the total amount of reserves can lead to an increase in money held by the public but it is an indirect effect. Running down the Fed's holdings of assets will also mean that the amount of reserves held by the banks will decline too. As with interest rate increases the Fed's approach is cautious. There is no hurry to get things back to what might be considered normal.The decline in its bond holdings in the first month will be no more than ten billion dollars, rising gradually over the course of the following year. We haven't been told what the ultimate level will be. But the Fed has said that the amount of reserves held by the banks when this process is complete is likely to be higher than before the crisis.All the time there is a degree of wariness among central bankers in the US and other developed economies that they could set back the recovery if they were to raise interest rates or change their QE policies too quickly. There was a warning in 2013 with an episode that came to be known as the ""taper tantrum"". That was a time when the Fed's QE bond purchases were in full swing.The then Chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke suggested that it might start to slow down the purchases - or taper its QE.That led to significant volatility in financial markets.  It most likely didn't too much lasting economic damage, but it has probably reinforced the cautious instincts of the current Fed Chair Janet Yellen.She certainly doesn't want to see another tantrum. She has said she wants the Fed's unwinding of its QE to be like ""watching paint dry"". "
"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed comments made by Donald Trump that the site has always been against him.The US president accused the social network of ""collusion"" on Twitter, branding it ""anti-Trump"".He made the same claim against the New York Times and the Washington Post. Facebook will shortly hand over 3,000 political adverts to congressional investigators probing alleged Russian meddling in the US election.The site believes the ads were probably purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 presidential contest.Facebook, Twitter and Google have been asked to testify before the US Senate Intelligence Committee on 1 November about the allegations of Russian interference.Facebook and Google have confirmed they have received invitations to attend the committee hearing, but none of the social media giants have yet said they will be present.Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San FranciscoMark Zuckerberg has made it clear in the past that he doesn't like Donald Trump - or at least, his policies. This statement shows frustration, I think. Not just with the president, but at the atmosphere swirling around Facebook at the moment - commentary that is painting it as a burden on the electoral process, and maybe even on society as a whole. He's trying to show all the good - as he sees it - that Facebook has done.He feels hard done by. And as a man obsessed by data and metrics, he's probably looking at the problem of Russian-backed fake news ads and seeing it as a minuscule part of all the election goings-on on his network of 2 billion people. But it's not the scale that's the issue here - but his immature refusal to face up to the public's concerns. It was less cover up, more can't-be-bothered. Mark Zuckerberg has surely by now realised that he must answer his users' concerns, even when he doesn't share them. His mistake may prove extremely costly - he's boosted those calling for stricter regulation of internet companies. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCIn a Facebook post responding to President Trump's criticism, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was striving to make ""a platform for all ideas"". He said that aside from ""problematic ads"", Facebook's impact ranged from ""giving people a voice, to enabling candidates to communicate directly, to helping millions of people vote"".He noted that both ends of the political spectrum were upset about content they disliked, and that liberals in the US had accused him of enabling Mr Trump's victory.  He said the candidates' campaigns had ""spent hundreds of millions advertising online,"" which he called ""1000x more than any problematic ads we've found"".The 33-year-old said he regretted saying on the day Mr Trump was elected that it was ""crazy"" to say that misinformation on Facebook changed the election's outcome, because it sounded dismissive. He promised Facebook would ""continue to build a community for all people"" - and to ""defend against nation states attempting to spread misinformation and subvert elections"".Mr Zuckerberg's response attracted 65,000 ""likes"" within two hours of being posted.The Kremlin has long denied any form of interference in the US election, and Mr Trump has railed against allegations that his staff had improper links to Russia.However, US intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow tried to sway the vote in favour of Mr Trump. Congressional committees and an FBI inquiry are currently probing the matter."
"More than 5,700 asylum seekers crossed illegally from the US into Canada last month, a rise of almost 80% on July, government figures show.Canada has seen a surge of refugee claimants in recent months, especially into the province of Quebec. Crossings have increased relatively steadily since January. There were 5,712 people intercepted by the Mounties last month at the Canada-US border, bringing this year's total to 13,211. In Manitoba, 80 people were intercepted after crossing the border. In British Columbia, 102 people were stopped. But the vast majority - 5,530 - crossed into Quebec in the first part of the month, where people can easily cross a ditch at the end of a rural New York state road into Canada. The influx into the predominantly French-speaking province was led by Haitians who had been living legally in the US, protected by a programme that extended temporary protection from deportation to Haitian citizens after the devastating 2010 earthquake.The Trump administration has hinted it will not extend that protection when it expires in January 2018. Canada completely lifted its own protected status for Haitians a year ago. In 2016, about 50% of all asylum claims by Haitians were rejected.Government officials have redoubled efforts to counteract misinformation helping bring asylum seekers to Canada's doorstep. In January, 315 people were intercepted in Canada after crossing the border, increasing to 887 in March and 3,134 in July.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tempered his language on refugees and immigration in recent weeks.He has noted that while Canada remains an ""opening and welcoming society"", it is still a country of laws with rigorous immigration and customs rules. In August, federal Liberal MP Emmanuel Dubourg, who is of Haitian origin and speaks Creole, was tasked with engaging extensively with Haitian media in American cities like Miami and New York.And earlier this month,  MP Pablo Rodriguez was sent to Los Angeles to meet with the Hispanic community there.Thousands of immigrants in the US from Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador also face losing their temporary protected status. The Canadian government is concerned they will also seek a second shot at asylum in the north.Asylum seekers are usually stopped immediately by the Mounties after crossing the border.Once apprehended, they are identified, searched and screened. If they are eligible to make an asylum claim, they are allowed entry and referred to the  Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. "
"Hello. Here's your morning briefing:US President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation extending his travel ban to include people from North Korea and Chad and some officials from Venezuela. They join five other countries - Iran, Libya, Yemen, Syria and Somalia - on the list, but one - Sudan - has been removed.The latest ban is set to come into effect on 18 October and doesn't affect people who already have a valid visa. Mr Trump said the US would ""not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet"". The US Supreme Court is due to consider the original ban next month, following several legal challenges.Angela Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU alliance has recorded its worst election result since 1949, but still remains the biggest group in Germany's parliament. Mrs Merkel, who becomes chancellor for a fourth term, faces a grim struggle to put together a governing coalition, which could take months. To add to the difficulty, her main rival, the left-of-centre SPD, also had its worst result since the 1940s and has ruled out serving with the CDU/CSU. But perhaps the biggest story of Germany's election is the right-wing, anti-Islam, AfD taking its first seats. It will be the third-biggest party in parliament.By Jenny Hill, Berlin correspondentIt was a chaotic day for German politics. And for Berlin too, which hosted the annual marathon as voters went to the polls. There is division, discontent, in the heart of this country.

He will say similar measures should be put in place to those imposed for payday loans in 2015, adding: ""It means that no-one will ever pay more in interest than their original loan."" The Conservatives said action was already being taken to outlaw ""rip-off credit card charges"". Meanwhile, some pro-EU Labour MPs have expressed anger after no Brexit motions were chosen to be voted on at the conference.Conservative disagreements over Brexit continue to garner much coverage, with the Daily Telegraph reporting that allies of Chancellor Philip Hammond have let it be known that they regard Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's approach to the issue as ""simple-minded"".

"A librarian at a primary school in the US state of Massachusetts has rejected a donation of books from First Lady Melania Trump.The librarian wrote a blog criticising Mrs Trump's literary choices, including children's favourites by Dr Seuss.Liz Phipps Soeiro, of Cambridgeport Elementary School, also criticised the Trump administration's policies.The White House picked one school from each US state to receive 10 books as part of National Read a Book Day.Mrs Trump said in a letter to the children who will receive the books: ""Getting an education is perhaps the most important and wondrous opportunity of your young lives.""But in a lengthy editorial for the Horn Book's Family Reading blog, Ms Phipps Soeiro explained why her school does not need the books, while thanking the first lady for her gesture.""My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science,"" she wrote. Her editorial disparaged the first lady's book selections, which included Green Eggs and Ham, Oh, the Places You'll Go! and The Cat in the Hat.""You may not be aware of this,"" wrote Ms Phipps Soeiro, ""but Dr Seuss is a bit of a cliché, a tired and worn ambassador for children's literature.

"A row over Trump administration officials' use of charter flights for business trips has deepened amid reports of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's use of the costly option.Mr Zinke flew from Las Vegas to Montana last June on a private jet that cost taxpayers more than $12,000, according to Politico and the Washington Post.Earlier, Health Secretary Tom Price apologised for his private plane trips.He said he would reimburse taxpayers and fly commercial in future.According to political news website Politico, Mr Price's travels have already cost the US taxpayer more than $1m (£750,000). The figure includes the cost of military aircraft used for Mr Price's trips abroad, and his use of private jets for domestic flights, Politico added.President Trump, who had earlier said he was ""not happy"" with the expense, said he would decide on Mr Price's future shortly.""He's a very fine man. We're going to make a decision sometime tonight,"" he told White House reporters. ""He's a very, very fine man.""Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, WashingtonNow that the ""Price-tag"" for the health secretary's private air travel has passed the million-dollar mark - with reports that other administration officials have a similar penchant for the Learjet lifestyle - the issue is metastasising from embarrassing to full-blown scandal.The reason this story particularly damages the White House is it cuts against one of Donald Trump's strengths and key campaign promises - that he has the business acumen to rein in runaway government spending, waste and abuse. What's more, Mr Price and EPA head Scott Pruitt have proposed drastic cuts to the budgets they oversee. For them to drop big dollars to avoid elbow-rubbing with the masses makes for painful headlines and fosters resentment within government ranks.Mr Price's promise to pay for the cost of ""his seat"" on those flights is already being decried as not good enough. It's the equivalent of buying an aged porterhouse steak on the federal dime and reimbursing for a hot dog.At some point, lest the White House appear responsible for creating a culture of profligacy, the president is going to have to do more than express dissatisfaction over these revelations. He will have to take action.As well as the Vegas-Montana trip - a route served by commercial flights - Mr Zinke is also reported to have used private jets between St Croix and St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands in March, and a military aircraft to travel to Norway in May.US government officials are expected to take commercial flights for work-related travel, unless they are dealing with national security matters.""As with previous interior secretaries, the secretary travelled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available,"" interior department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement. ""All travel is pre-approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence.""Two other members of Mr Trump's cabinet are under scrutiny by inspectors for their use of private planes while on the job: Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, responding to the latest revelations, urged Mr Trump ""to emphasise to cabinet secretaries the necessity of using reasonable and cost-effective modes of travel in accordance with federal restrictions""."
"US President Donald Trump will travel to five Asian countries in November to participate in regional summits, the White House has announced.He will visit Japan, China, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and the US state of Hawaii for an 11-day trip.""The president's engagements will strengthen the international resolve to confront the North Korean threat"", the White House statement said.North Korea and the US have engaged in heated rhetoric in recent months.So what will the key issues be for the US president on his first official trip to Asia?The economically-isolated Asian country conducted its sixth nuclear explosive test earlier this month despite international condemnation, and has promised to conduct another test in the Pacific Ocean.At a speech to the United Nations, Mr Trump threatened to annihilate North Korea, saying the country's leader, Kim Jong-un,"" is on a suicide mission"".In exchange, Mr Kim in a rare statement, vowed to ""tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire"".Mr Trump will seek to rally the country's neighbours - including China - to continue an economic sanctions campaign against North Korea. Several countries, especially Japan, were upset when Mr Trump withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact - a deal which had been more than five years in the making and affected 40% of the global economy.The 11 remaining countries, including Japan and Vietnam, will continue the pact and have left the door open for the US to rejoin at any time, however a US trade representative has vowed that Mr Trump will not change his decision.""Bilateral negotiations are better for the United States than multilateral negotiations,"" said trade representative Robert Lighthizer.Territorial disputes have pitted several smaller nations against much-larger China, which views the sea as part of its sphere of influence.Japanese and Filipino sailors have often clashed at sea with Chinese military vessels, and nations have been so far unable to establish a clear border.After a US Navy destroyer collided with a merchant ship in the South China Sea in August - resulting in 10 dead US sailors - a state-run newspaper in Beijing said the ""US Navy has behaved arrogantly in the Asia-Pacific region"".Mr Duterte's human rights record has been criticised, as his country wages war against drug dealers and users.  As a result, it had been rumoured in Washington that Mr Trump may skip the ASEAN summit happening in Manila.But now the White House schedule confirms that he will attend.Daily life goes on in world's most secretive capital"
"The US current account deficit, which is the broadest measure of US trade, rose to $123.1bn (£91bn) in the second quarter - its highest level since 2008.The rising gap was driven by a $5.2bn fall in income receipts from foreigners, particularly in government fines and penalties.The Commerce Department said exports of US goods also slipped, while US income from overseas investments shrank.Donald Trump's administration has made reducing the deficit a focus.The president maintains that persistent deficits have cost the US jobs.But analysts say the deficit shows strong demand from foreigners for US investments, which can sustain American spending on foreign goods and the like.""The current account deficit... is really not that worrying because the United States appears to have little difficulty attracting the net capital inflows that are needed to finance the red ink in the current account,"" wrote Jay Bryson, an economist at Wells Fargo.The current account is often referred to as the difference between US public and private savings and investment. It measures the import and export of goods and services, as well as financial flows.The US has run persistent deficits since the early 1990s.In recent months, the gap has increased as higher oil prices raise import costs and foreigners see strong returns on US investments, Mr Bryson wrote. The deficit amounted to 2.6% of GDP in the second quarter. That remains lower than in 2005, when the deficit totalled more than 6% of GDP."
"The US has insisted it will leave the Paris climate accord, despite reports that it may be softening its stance.Following a meeting of environment ministers on Saturday, the EU climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Canete, said Trump officials had indicated the US would either stay in the 2015 accord or review its terms.But the White House insisted there had been ""no change"" in the US position.In June President Donald Trump said the US would withdraw from the deal.He said it was part of his ""solemn duty to protect America"" and he would seek a new deal that would not disadvantage US businesses.But opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge.The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up to the deal.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, he characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US.He claimed the agreement would cost the US 6.5 million jobs and $3tn (£2.2tn) in lost GDP - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably.""In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States,"" he said.During his visit to France in July, however, Mr Trump hinted that the US could shift its position on the deal - but did not elaborate.""Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord... We'll see what happens.""On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal quoted Mr Arias as saying that Trump administration officials said the US would not pull out of the agreement, and were offering to re-engage in the deal.The WSJ said the shift in the position came at a meeting of environment ministers from about 30 countries at a gathering in Montreal, Canada.That meeting was attended by a US observer.The US ""stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris Accord, but they [will] try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement,"" Mr Canete said.He said that ""there would be a meeting on the sidelines of next week's UN General Assembly with American representatives ""to assess what is the real US position"", according to the AFP news agency.""It's a message which is quite different to the one we heard from President Trump in the past,"" Mr Canete added.At the same time, Chilean Environment Minister Marcelo Mena tweeted (in Spanish): ""I was in the meeting, and the [US] negotiator effectively did not close the door on continuing in the agreement, and ruled out looking for a new agreement.""But in a statement later on Saturday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: ""There has been no change in the United States' position on the Paris agreement,""As the president has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favourable to our country.""Bloomberg reported that the US is ""no longer seeking to withdraw from the pact and then renegotiate it, but rather wants to re-engage with the Paris Agreement from within"".While the White House insists its stance has not changed, deciding not to withdraw from the Paris deal and instead focus on negotiating while remaining a signatory would represent a significant about-turn.The Los Angeles Times said staying in the Paris deal would be ""one of the most controversial"" reversals of the Trump presidency.It would also risk angering Mr Trump's more conservative supporters at a time he is facing criticism for engaging with Democratic leaders, the liberal magazine Mother Jones wrote."
"The US Senate Intelligence Committee has criticised Twitter for offering an ""inadequate"" appearance in briefings on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Democratic Senator Mark Warner said the briefings were ""deeply disappointing"".The social network earlier said it had shut down about 200 accounts linked to a Russian misinformation campaign.It follows a review by Facebook which found Russian-funded adverts helping to spread false misinformation online.Twitter said it found a match for 22 of roughly 450 accounts Facebook shared, and another 179 ""linked accounts"".Russia has repeatedly denied claims that it interfered in the US elections.Twitter made the announcement as it briefed members of the US government behind closed doors.Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are looking into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election - something the Kremlin strongly denies.The Facebook case involved thousands of adverts, purchased in Russia, which directed users towards hundreds of different Facebook accounts. Those accounts did not support any particular candidate, but instead posted inflammatory information on hot topics such as immigration. In one example, CNN reported an advert referencing the Black Lives Matter movement was deliberately targeted to reach people in Ferguson, Missouri - home to violent protests over the shooting of unarmed black men by police officers from late 2014.Twitter said it had banned all accounts found to break its rules, including rules on spam. Unlike the Facebook investigation, none was registered as an advertiser, it said.The company also revealed that accounts belonging to state-funded Russian media network Russia Today - which it said had ""strong links to the Russian government"" - had spent about $274,100 on ads targeting the US market during 2016. However, paying social networks to promote tweets is a common strategy among media organisations.Twitter's banning of the accounts has not placated lawmakers, according to reports. Senator Warner said Twitter's appearance at the joint committee session was disappointing and revealed little new information.""Their response was, frankly, inadequate on almost every level,"" he told reporters.His party colleague on the House committee, Adam Schiff, said Twitter had taken only ""remedial steps"" against accounts linked to Russia.""We look forward to hearing more from Twitter as we continue to investigate how Russia sought to push disinformation and fake news through the use of bots and false personas to influence the outcome of the election,"" he said.Twitter said it would continue to investigate.Thursday's intelligence committee briefings were closed, and it is not clear if additional information was shared with lawmakers beyond what Twitter wrote in its public blog post.""Due to the nature of these inquiries, we may not always be able to publicly share what we discuss with investigators. And there will always be tools or methods we cannot talk about, because doing so would only help bad actors circumvent them,"" the company said.Both Facebook and Twitter, along with Google, are expected to be invited to appear in separate open sessions before both intelligence committees in the coming months."
"Chad has called on the US government to reverse its decision to include the country on its travel ban list. Foreign Minister Madeleine Alingué said in a statement that the decision undermined the image of Chad and good relations between the two countries. She added that Chad was a partner in the fight against terrorism and that the ban would ruin its bilateral relationship with the US.Citizens of Chad are now banned from gaining business and tourist visas for the US. Seven other countries are also affected by the ban - Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea and Venezuela - while Sudan was removed from the list.US President Donald Trump's original ban in March was highly controversial, as it affected six majority-Muslim countries, and was widely labelled a ""Muslim ban"". It has been challenged in court.President Trump's proclamation will come as a surprise to many Lake Chad Basin watchers, but US intelligence suggests that Chadian authorities have not been sharing information relating to public safety and terrorism with their US counterparts. The US also said that Chad, a mainly Muslim country, was a haven for jihadist groups but among the Lake Chad Basin nations (Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria) , it has suffered the fewest attacks from Boko Haram militants. There is little to indicate that the activity of these groups in Chad is anywhere as significant as in, for example, Nigeria, which recently received US support in an arms and aircraft deal.Chad has been, in Washington's words, ""an important and valuable"" partner in the fight against Islamist militancy and its capital Ndjamena is home to the headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) formed to tackle Boko Haram.Chad has also hosted the annual US-led Flintlock military exercise in West Africa three times. France is another Western power that has seen value in keeping Chad close, basing its regional counter-terrorism force Operation Barkhane in Ndjamena.It has not expressed any concerns - at least, not publicly - about its African partner not sharing intelligence. President Idris Deby has long complained about the lack of international support in funding the fight against Boko Haram, even threatening to withdraw his troops from the MNJTF. His forces have struggled to sufficiently police its vast northern regions and this could be part of what the US is concerned about. However, over the years, Chadian troops have proven their effectiveness in battle during military interventions in the Central African Republic and Mali.More recently, they made a significant contribution in suppressing Boko Haram fighters between 2014 and 2015 when the group controlled huge swathes of territory in neighbouring Nigeria.Losing Chad's cooperation would be major blow to counter-terrorism efforts in the region. This curious attempt to arm-twist the central African nation could be counter-productive.Observers wonder whether Chad's troubles started when it attempted to slap a record $74bn fine on US oil giant Exxon Mobil. At the time, the current US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson headed the company. Exxon Mobil was accused of not making royalty payments but eventually avoided the fine, more than seven times Chad's gross domestic product, as both parties reached a settlement. There is however little to suggest it was the cause of this ban.Chad might feel hard done-by to suffer this punishment despite its counter-terrorism track record, while its eastern neighbour Sudan - labelled as a state sponsor of terrorism - is being removed from the US' bad books. President Deby would not want to see his country experience similar diplomatic and economic isolation (from the West, at least).Sudan will see its omission from the travel ban list as a sign that the Trump administration will also remove wider economic sanctions on the country on 12 October. The sanctions were first put in place in 1997 when Sudan was named a state sponsor of terrorism, while further penalties were imposed for alleged abuses carried out in the troubled Darfur region. The State Department concluded that Sudan was cooperating better on counter-terrorism, and in improving humanitarian access to conflict areas, like Darfur. In August, the Deputy Commander of the US Africa Command, General Alexander Laskaris, visited the capital Khartoum as both countries worked on resuming military cooperation. Sudan will see the thawing of relations with the US and the outside world as a boost as it seeks to revive its bruised economy, one of the largest in the region. It will welcome the renewed ability to trade freely with international partners and see this as a path to attracting investment in its agriculture, mining and petroleum sectors."
"The US solar industry has seen dramatic growth in the past few years, but a request for a rare trade action has led to a fierce fight over the future of the industry - and one that wouldn't exist without the presidency of Donald Trump.Phil Brodhagen runs a solar installation company in Colorado Springs, and his customers - local homeowners and businesses in a military-friendly town - love American-made products.Until they see the price.""They want to go solar, but they do have a limit on how much they can spend."" he says. ""They'd love an American product, but if they can't afford it, they'll either not get a system at all, or go for the cheaper one.""Brodhagen is one of hundreds of business owners across the US paying very close attention to a case in front of the US International Trade Commission. And he's worried about the outcome.""It will hurt this industry,"" he says. ""It's going to be me laying off people as well as everyone else.""On Friday, the commission is expected to rule on whether imported solar products have seriously injured US solar product manufacturers, enough to impose higher tariffs on imports worldwide.The petition was brought by two solar manufacturers who are based in the US, but owned by overseas companies.Suniva and SolarWorld have argued their financial troubles - as well as a series of other US solar manufacturer bankruptcies - are due to a massive oversupply of solar cells and panels imported from overseas, primarily from Chinese companies.They point to dozens of US companies like theirs that have gone out of business since 2012.""Quite simply, we need the commission's help to save solar manufacturing in the United States,"" Juergen Stein, chief executive of SolarWorld Americans told the commission in August.But SolarWorld and Suniva find themselves fiercely opposed by much of the solar industry in the US, including the largest trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).SEIA has argued increasing the prices of panels through tariffs will set back the solar industry for years, hurting companies that buy and install solar panels, or make solar-related products. The trade group estimates a loss of as many as 88,000 jobs, or a third of the current solar work force, if Suniva and SolarWorld's requests come to pass.The group accuses the two companies of using the rare trade action to save themselves, at the expense of the rest of the industry.What's at stake? For both sides, the immediate future of the fast-growing solar industry in America.Bret Sowers, a utility-scale solar farm developer, calls the trade case an ""eminent threat"" to his business. Projects like his are reliant on how low a price per watt cost they can offer utility firms. Their competition is not just other solar firms, but coal and wind, natural gas and nuclear energy.New solar capacity doubled between 2015 and 2016 and such large-scale projects drove more than half the growth.""We have close to $2bn in investment we've planned across the southeast,"" he says, based on prices continuing their downward trend. If he can't deliver the prices he expected, those solar farms won't be built.""That's hundreds of construction jobs gone,"" he says, and layoffs at his company.Sowers is specifically frustrated because US plants at SolarWorld and Suniva were not building the larger, 72-cell panels at the kind of scale his projects need.""The two dots don't really connect. They were making cars and I'm buying trucks - and now they're claiming the trucks are hurting the cars.""James Marlow, who runs a similar Georgia company, is frustrated with the petition, even though he just finished a project with Suniva panels.""They used to be the home town team,"" he says of the firm, originally spun out from Georgia Tech and headquartered in the state.In 2015, in an effort to expand, a Hong Kong-based energy firm purchased more than half the company, but Suniva filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and weeks later, brought the trade petition.SolarWorld, whose parent company also filed for insolvency in Germany, joined the petition shortly thereafter.Marlow says he supports bringing back manufacturing to America, but thinks that means a whole set of policies to deal with what's a ""drastically larger"" issue.""It's why most of our clothes are made in Asia and why this cell phone I'm talking to you on made in Asia - it's not just one action.""He attended the 15 August arguments in front of the trade commission on the case and said interest was intense. There were two overflow rooms for people to listen. An official told him they hadn't seen that many people come to hear a case since NAFTA.If the trade commission finds in favour of the manufacturers, it can make recommendations, but it is up to the president to decide.And President Trump is eager to impose tariffs, especially in an industry in which he could be seen to be tough on Chinese manufacturing. He reportedly has said ""I want someone to bring me some tariffs"" because ""China is laughing at us"".Once the trade commission makes its initial ruling, it will have several more weeks to make a recommendation to Trump. The president then can decide to take the recommendation or not.Solarworld had earlier successes with two requests for increased tariffs on Chinese manufacturers for similar unfair trade practice accusations.But that wasn't enough, says Tim Brightbill, a lawyer representing SolarWorld, because Chinese firms shifted production to other countries to get around the tariffs.He also claims the potential job loss numbers are overblown.""These predictions were made before when SolarWorld brought actions against China, that somehow jobs would be lost. But the opposite happened,"" Brightbill says.The situation is especially odd considering both SolarWorld and Suniva are owned by parent companies that could be harmed by the tariff.Brightbill says ""it just shows that SolarWorld is committed to manufacturing here,"" even if it involves putting a tariff on a German-produced panel.They may not be alone. While the US solar industry is holding its breath, foreign manufacturers are starting to think about setting up shop in the US, especially if the commission recommends a broad tariff.Both sides see the dispute as a turning point for the industry - and both think the president should be on their side.""If the Trump administration wants to create jobs,"" James Marlow says. ""They should join with the solar industry.""The question for President Trump will be - which part?"
"The US economy grew even faster in the second quarter than previously thought, new figures have indicated.The Commerce Department said it grew at a 3.1% annual rate over the three months to the end of June, up from a previous estimate of 3%, which was itself revised up from an initial 2.6%.The further upward revision came as a surprise to analysts, who had it expected it to stay the same.Higher consumer spending, helped boost the figure, as did state expenditure.The US economy is now growing at the fastest rate in two years.""Growth was solid in the second quarter, but that was after a soft first quarter,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group.""The economy has been expanding at a pace of between 2% and 2.5% throughout the current economic expansion, which started in 2009. ""This is below the pace of previous expansions, in part because of demographic changes in the US, most notably slower labour force growth with the retirement of the baby boomers."""
"Hillary Clinton has called reports that six Trump White House officials used private email accounts for official business the ""height of hypocrisy"".President Donald Trump repeatedly attacked Mrs Clinton's use of personal email while she was secretary of state during the 2016 campaign. Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner admitted to using his email while five other aides reportedly did so as well. Congress has asked the White House to provide details on the practice. Speaking to Sirius XM radio on Monday, Mrs Clinton said: ""It's just the height of hypocrisy.""She said the Trump administration ""knew that there was no basis for all their hyperventilating"" about her emails. ""It is something that if they were sincere about it, I think you'd have Republican members of Congress calling for an investigation,"" she added.The former Democratic presidential candidate added that her use of a private server at the State Department was ""a dumb mistake but a dumber scandal"".She said she regretted the country ""had to go through it"". Mr Kushner, a senior White House adviser, has been asked to preserve all his emails. The New York Times has named the other staffers implicated as Steve Bannon, the former chief White House strategist; Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff; and advisers Gary D Cohn and Stephen Miller.Meanwhile, Newsweek magazine says it has details of an email Ivanka Trump sent about collaboration with a business organisation, copying in two federal officials.The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has a responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness and accountability of federal government, has sent a letter to the White House demanding more information.The letter was signed jointly by Republican Trey Gowdy, who chairs the committee, and Democrat Elija Cummings, the second most senior member. Addressed to White House Counsel Donald McGahn, it says: ""Have you or any non-career official at the White House ever used a personal email account to conduct official business?""If so, please identify the individual and the account used, and provide evidence of measures to ensure compliance with federal law.""The letter sets a deadline of 9 October for the disclosure of more information. It is not illegal for White House officials to use personal email accounts for government business.However, under the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act, government officials must forward any official correspondence to a work account within 20 days for preservation.If this is not done reliably, the use of private accounts can put official records beyond the reach of journalists, lawmakers and others who seek publicly available information.In a statement Mr Kushner's lawyer said: ""Fewer than 100 emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account.""He said most were news articles or political commentary and ""all have been preserved in any event"".There are also rules against sharing classified or privileged information on personal email accounts.However, there is no suggestion that Mr Kushner or any of the others named did this.There are some key differences between the two cases.Mrs Clinton had set up a private email server from her New York home - and used an email hosted by the server for all her emails, including at least 30,000 official emails, during her four years as secretary of state.She did not use, or even activate, a state.gov email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government.The FBI said that ""several thousand"" work-related emails were not turned over to the State Department, and that Mrs Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information. However, an investigation into the matter was closed without charges.It is not clear how many official emails Ms Trump, Mr Bannon, Mr Priebus, Mr Cohn and Mr Miller sent from their personal accounts.However, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that all White House employees had been told ""if they receive work-related communication on personal accounts, they should be forwarded to official email accounts""."
"Donald Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was wiretapped by the FBI due to concerns about his links with Moscow, according to US media.The reported surveillance, granted under a court warrant, occurred both before and after the 2016 election.It is not known if the wiretap, which began in 2014, included conversations with President Trump. Mr Manafort is said to be facing an indictment.His spokesman called on the Justice Department to investigate the leak. ""If true, it is a felony to reveal the existence of a Fisa warrant, regardless of the fact that no charges ever emerged,"" said Jason Maloni, referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) warrants.""The US Department of Justice's Inspector General should immediately conduct an investigation into these leaks and to examine the motivations behind a previous Administration's effort to surveil a political opponent."" He urged the Justice Department to also release ""any intercepts"" involving Mr Manafort. The former political consultant, who had worked for Ukraine's former ruling party, was chairman of the Trump campaign from June to August 2016. He has not commented on the CNN report, which has been confirmed by CBS News.FBI special counsel Robert Mueller is leading an investigation into alleged attempts by Russia to influence the 2016 election. However, the Fisa warrants were granted before his investigation started, and were first authorised as part of an investigation into Washington consulting firms working for Ukraine, CNN reported.After the 2014 warrant ended, it was renewed again until earlier this year, in order to allow the FBI to investigate ties between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian operatives.Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, WashingtonBack in March Donald Trump was widely derided for tweeting that President Barack Obama ""had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory"". Now some Republicans are crowing that the latest revelations vindicate Mr Trump's accusations.That's not exactly the case. Paul Manafort was the target of the surveillance, not Mr Trump - although the former Trump campaign chairman has an apartment in Trump Tower. And if Mr Trump spoke with Mr Manafort, then it's entirely possible those conversations could have been recorded.The pressure is mounting on Mr Manafort now. He was being monitored by the FBI. Robert Mueller's team executed an unannounced search of his property and confiscated files earlier this year. He has reportedly been warned that he is facing criminal charges.It's a standard practice of law enforcement to put the screws on the first round of targets in the hope of gaining their assistance in later prosecutions. Given his top position in the Trump campaign for months, Mr Manafort could be the key to Mr Mueller's investigations.If the president and his former aide ever spoke about anything incriminating, the vindication his supporters are feeling today will seem cold comfort.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpCommunications collected with the Manafort wiretaps sparked concerns among investigators that he had encouraged the Russians to help with the election campaign, CNN cited three sources as saying - although two of the sources said the evidence had not been conclusive. The FBI, as well as several congressional committees, are investigating whether Russia attempted to interfere in the US election in order to help Donald Trump.According to a Reuters report, President Trump is using re-election campaign contributions and money donated to the Republican National Committee to pay for his legal team in the ongoing Russian investigation. The US Federal Election Commission allows private campaign funds to be used for legal bills that stem from being a candidate or elected official. But Mr Trump would be the first US president in the modern campaign finance era to use campaign money to pay for legal defence in a criminal probe, according to Reuters.FBI agents raided Mr Manafort's suburban Washington DC home on 26 July, according to the New York Times.Agents had picked the lock to his Virginia home as Mr Manafort lay in bed, and were looking for evidence that he had set up off-shore bank accounts, the newspaper reported.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr Trump, said Monday that she ""wouldn't rule out"" questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election if evidence emerged of Russian interference."
"US President Donald Trump has stepped up his criticism of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, calling them ""disgraceful"".Speaking at a White House press conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Mr Trump said the NFL should ban players from kneeling.He denied he had been preoccupied with the issue at the expense of the hurricane disaster in Puerto Rico.""It's called respect for our country,"" he told reporters.A number of sports players and teams demonstrated during the US national anthem over the weekend.The protests involved players kneeling, linking arms or staying in the locker room during the Star-Spangled Banner.Mr Trump said on Tuesday he was ""ashamed"" of the protests.He said he recently visited maimed US veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in the Washington DC suburbs.""They were fighting for our country,"" he said, ""they were fighting for our flag, they were fighting for our national anthem.""For people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem, I think, is disgraceful.""The president first said on Friday at a rally in Alabama that players who fail to stand during the national anthem should be fired or suspended.His criticism seemed to galvanise players, teams and the league to assert what they saw as a right to freely express political convictions. National Football League (NFL) player Colin Kaepernick first sat down during the anthem in preseason in 2016.""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour,"" he said.Kaepernick continued to demonstrate amid fierce criticism; this season he remains a free agent. Some commentators suggest he may have been ""blackballed"" from the sport as clubs fear a backlash for signing him.President Trump had faced widespread criticism for tweeting repeatedly about the NFL, amid accusations that federal aid has been slow to reach Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands."
"Former US First Lady Michelle Obama has lashed out at female voters who backed President Donald Trump.""Any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice,"" she said. Mrs Obama, who has stayed largely out of the political fray since leaving the White House, made the remark at a Boston conference.She reflected on the 2016 election as an example of staying true to her ""authentic self"".""Quite frankly, we saw this in this election. As far as I'm concerned, any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice,"" Mrs Obama said on Wednesday during a question-and-answer session at Inbound, a marketing and sales conference in Boston. She continued that many Americans decided last November that Mr Trump's ""voice is more true to me"". Mrs Obama insisted, however, that she wanted Mr Trump to succeed.""We want the sitting president to be successful because we live in this country,"" she said. ""He is our commander in chief, he was voted in.""Just 54% of women voted for Mrs Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump last year, while 52% of white women voted for her Republican opponent. ""Well, to me that just says, you don't like your voice. You like the thing you're told to like,"" she said of Mr Trump. Mrs Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, campaigned for Mrs Clinton during last year's election. She famously said of Mrs Clinton's detractors: ""When they go low, we go high"".The Obamas have retreated from the public eye since leaving the White House last January until they inked a book deal with Penguin Random House last March to write separate memoirs. The contract is worth $60m (£48m).Her remarks about the 2016 election were some of the thoughts ""rolling around in [her] head"" as she writes her book, she said on Wednesday. ""This is the first time in eight years, probably 10 years, that I'll have a chance to think back on what it all meant,"" she continued.She said that she and Mr Obama have learned that part of their ""legacy is leading with grace"".During the election campaign in February last year, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright provoked outrage when she introduced Hillary Clinton at a New Hampshire event, saying: ""There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other!""Ms Albright later apologised."
"The Trump administration has confirmed plans to repeal an Obama administration rule to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has voiced doubt of climate change, called the Clean Power Plan an overreach.President Donald Trump ordered the EPA to rewrite the rule in March.The Clean Power Plan requires states to meet carbon emission reduction targets based on their energy consumption. Mr Pruitt said he would sign the proposed rule to begin withdrawing from the plan on Tuesday.""The war on coal is over,"" he told a crowd in Hazard, Kentucky, on Monday.He continued: ""That rule really was about picking winners and losers. ""Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers.""Mr Pruitt has previously argued that the Clean Power Plan would force states to favour renewable energy in the electricity-generation market.As Oklahoma's attorney general, he took part in a lawsuit by 27 US states against the rule.A Supreme Court ruling in February 2016 left the regulation in limbo.The EPA under President Barack Obama said the Clean Power Plan could prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and 6,600 premature deaths.But according to US media, a leaked draft of the repeal proposal disputes the health benefits touted by the previous administration.The draft also reportedly argues the country would save $33bn (£25bn) by dropping the regulation.The Clean Power Plan required states to devise a way to cut planet-warming emissions by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.     Eliminating the rule would make it difficult for the US to fulfil its promise to cut emissions as part of the Paris Climate accord, a 2015 international agreement which President Obama signed with nearly 200 other countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming. Mr Trump in June signalled that he would pull out of the pact, dismantling his predecessor's environmental legacy. In August the Trump administration issued its first written notification to the UN that it intended to withdraw from the agreement. But the move was largely viewed as symbolic as no nation seeking to leave the pact can officially announce an intention to withdraw until 4 November 2019.The process of leaving then takes another year, meaning it would not be complete until just weeks after the US presidential election in 2020.The planned repeal of the Clean Power Plan has sparked outrage among environmental groups. The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) threatened to sue the EPA if the plan is repealed while the Sierra Club has indicated it would fight any new rule that does not comply with the country's air pollution laws.Mary Anne Hitt, the director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, said in a statement the Trump administration was ""putting the safety of our communities at risk, and making it crystal clear they have no intention of safeguarding people from the very real, immediate dangers of climate change"". "
"Ex-New York congressman Anthony Weiner burst into tears as he was sentenced to 21 months in jail for sending sexually explicit messages to an underage girl.He pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor and agreed not to appeal against a prison sentence of 27 months or less.Weiner, 53, quit Congress in 2011 over a sex scandal and was again exposed in his 2013 run for New York mayor.His lawyers had asked a US District Judge for probation instead of jail. But in sentencing Weiner, US District Judge Denise Cote said: ""This is a serious crime that deserves serious punishment.""She also said Weiner ""has a disease. He has a compulsivity. Some say a sex addiction.""Acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H Kim said in a statement that Weiner ""asked a girl who he knew to be 15 years old to display her naked body and engage in sexually explicit behaviour for him online"".  ""Justice demands that this type of conduct be prosecuted and punished with time in prison.""In addition to jail time, Weiner was sentenced to three years of supervised release, according to a statement from the US Attorney's Office. Weiner's lawyers contended the former politician had acted out of the ""depths of an uncontrolled sickness"" and was now seeking treatment. In a letter to Judge Cote, Weiner said he felt ""profound"" regret for his crimes and that his misconduct had ""crushed the aspirations"" of his wife, Huma Abedin, and ruined their marriage. Ms Abedin filed for divorce on the same day as her husband was found guilty in May. She did not attend the sentencing, but asked for leniency on their son's behalf in a letter to the judge. The FBI began investigating Weiner last September after the Daily Mail reported that he had exchanged obscene messages with a North Carolina teenager. The 15-year-old girl said he had asked her to undress on camera. A month earlier, Ms Abedin announced she was separating from her husband after it emerged he sent a photo of himself in his underpants with his toddler son nearby.The New York Post reported that Weiner had sent sexual messages along with the photo to an unidentified woman in 2015.Once a rising Democratic star, he stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after a graphic image sent from his Twitter account went public.Initially claiming his account was hacked, he eventually confessed to having lied.Weiner also admitted indulging in explicit online exchanges with at least six other women and pledged to seek therapy. He tried to revive his political career in 2013 by running for mayor of New York.But his campaign imploded amid reports of further graphic online messages. The investigation into Weiner's sexting case played a role in last year's 2016 presidential election, when authorities found emails on his laptop from Ms Abedin, who was a senior aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. A separate FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's private use of email while she was secretary of state was closed after officials said nothing incriminating was found. "
"Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been registered to vote as a woman for eight years, it is claimed.His gender is listed as ""female"" in records from the New York State Board of Elections, according to screen grabs published by Wired.The images suggest Mr Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president, registered to vote in November 2009.The former property investor has not commented on the news, so it remains unclear how the error occurred. The mistake is unlikely to constitute voter fraud, as that requires the culprit to deliberately give false information. President Trump was bombastic on the subject after the 2016 US election, tweeting that ""millions of people"" had ""voted illegally"", but without offering any evidence.While Mr Trump won the election via the electoral college, he actually received 2.86 million fewer votes than Democrat Hillary Clinton.The president formed an advisory commission specifically to focus on alleged electoral fraud, but at least 20 states rebuffed its request for data on registered voters, including their names, addresses, and voting history.It is not the first time Mr Kushner is reported to have filled out his paperwork incorrectly. In July, CBS said he had to submit his federal disclosure form for security clearance three times.He initially left a section asking about foreign contacts empty before eventually updating it to include more than 100 names. The Washington Post alleged that he listed the dates of his graduate degrees incorrectly and did not include the address of his father-in-law, President Trump.Mr Kushner said his team sent the form by mistake before he could fill it in fully.The latest headlines come just days after it emerged that he and his wife Ivanka had used private email accounts to carry out official White House business.The move raised eyebrows as Mr Trump repeatedly attacked Mrs Clinton's use of personal email while she was secretary of state during the 2016 campaign.The former Democratic presidential candidate called the situation ""the height of hypocrisy"".The New York Times has named four other members of Mr Trump's team who are also believed to have used personal email accounts. They are Steve Bannon, the former chief White House strategist; Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff; and advisers Gary D Cohn and Stephen Miller."
"Senator John McCain has said he cannot support his fellow Republicans' latest effort to repeal Obamacare, dealing it a potentially fatal blow.The Arizona senator, who is battling brain cancer, said he ""cannot in good conscience"" vote for the new plan, which President Donald Trump backs.Mr McCain said it was wrong to pass such far-reaching legislation without input from the Democrats.It is the second time he has thwarted his party leadership on the issue.President Trump, speaking in Alabama late on Friday, condemned Republicans who did not back the new legislation, saying: ""They don't have the guts to vote for it.""Republicans need 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48 to succeed. With Democrats united in opposition, there is little margin for error.Mr McCain's objection could doom conservatives' seven-year campaign to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement.In a statement on Friday, the Arizona senator said such a bill demands extensive hearings, debate and amendment.""That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform,"" he wrote, ""without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority."" Mr McCain said he could not support a rushed bill ""without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect [sic] insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it"". One other Republican senator, Rand Paul, is also against the party's latest bill.Susan Collins indicated on Friday afternoon she may join the opposition.The Maine senator said she was worried the legislation did not do enough to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.""I'm leaning against the bill,"" Ms Collins said at a constituency event.At least four other Republican senators are undecided: Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran.Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporterAs several Republican senators explained - ones who were firm ""yesses"" - the main attraction for the plan was that it was the only plan on the table.Now it appears Republicans will have to go back to the drawing board. Although the end of September is the deadline for passing a bill with a simple majority in the Senate for this federal budget, there's no reason the party couldn't start the wheels turning for another vote next year - or, conceivably, simply change the rules, as Donald Trump has suggested.None of that will alter the simple dynamic that made itself clear over the course of the past months, however. The Republican Party, despite campaigning ferociously for Obamacare repeal for nearly seven years, could never agree on how to turn those promises into reality without sending the healthcare industry into a tailspin.Read more from AnthonyFollow @awzurcherThe Republican leadership had evidently hoped South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the bill's authors, might be able to persuade his close friend Mr McCain to back the measure.Undeterred on Friday, Mr Graham vowed: ""We press on.""President Trump has been phoning lawmakers and state governors in a bid to tilt the scales in favour of the bill. But several Republican governors this week also criticised the process as rushed, urging colleagues to abandon the proposal in favour of a slower, cross-party approach.Sixteen major medical groups meanwhile issued a joint statement against the Republican legislation.US Vice-President Mike Pence said on Thursday the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill was their ""last best chance"" to repeal Obamacare.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was planning to bring the legislation to a vote next week, but it is unclear now if that will go ahead.Republicans are still reeling from the collapse in July of their efforts to secure Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal Obamacare.A dramatic late-night 'no' vote from Mr McCain - just days after he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour - sunk that bill, too.According to analysis released on Friday, if the Graham-Cassidy bill were to pass, 32 million fewer Americans would have health insurance by 2027.And the non-partisan Brookings Institution said its findings ""likely understates the reductions in insurance coverage"".The new bill, also drafted by Senator Bill Cassidy, would give states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programmes.But critics say that when left to the states, the money going into the Medicaid programme for people on low incomes would diminish.Republicans have long deplored Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act, as government overreach into the US healthcare system."
"A federal judge in Chicago has blocked an order requiring cities to fully cooperate with immigration officials or risk losing some federal funding.The ruling is a fresh blow to US President Donald Trump, who has promised to end illegal immigration and so-called ""sanctuary cities"".The judge said it was likely Attorney General Jeff Sessions had overstepped his authority with the order.The preliminary injunction applies to more than 400 cities nationwide.In July, Mr Sessions announced that certain funding would only be awarded to jurisdictions allowing federal immigration officers into detention facilities and which gave 48 hours' notice before releasing inmates wanted by the federal authorities.It was seen as a further attempt to punish cities and other areas that are part of the ""sanctuary"" movement aimed at shielding illegal immigrants from stepped-up deportation efforts.More about 'sanctuary cities'Life as refugees in US 'sanctuary cities' Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration filed a lawsuit in August against the Sessions order arguing that it was unconstitutional.Lawyers for the city also claimed that withholding funding creates a dangerous precedent in which the federal government could begin withholding money from jurisdictions that disagree with the president's priorities.""The court finds that the city has established that it would suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is not entered,"" US District Judge Harry Leinenweber said in his 41-page ruling.The Trump administration argues that the deportation crackdown is aimed at immigrants convicted of serious crimes and that public safety is jeopardised when immigration authorities are not informed of impending releases."
"The US dollar, long a symbol of American economic might, has fallen steadily this year. The value of the dollar index, which tracks the dollar against six major global currencies, has fallen about 10% since January. It pushed lower on Friday, even as demand for other safe-haven assets - typically a category that includes the US dollar - rose amid sabre-rattling between the US and North Korea. The dollar, which surged in 2014 as the US economy gained strength, is hardly in danger territory. The index is running just a bit lower than it was a year ago.But key US economic data was weaker last year. So what's behind this year's decline?In some ways, this is a good news story, driven by a better economy in Europe.The euro lost ground against the dollar in 2014, when central bankers adopted a stimulus program, while the US started to move away from stimulus policies.Now, as the Eurozone economy improves and the European Central Bank eyes an end to the stimulus, the currencies are starting to move closer together. The election of pro-EU Emmanuel Macron in France in June contributed to confidence in the Euro.The Euro's gain is the dollar's loss. A Euro is now worth more than $1.17, up more than 10 cents since the end of last year.But this isn't just a European story.The dollar has lost ground against many other currencies, including the Japanese Yen, the Mexican peso and the Swedish Krona. Even the British pound, which plunged after the Brexit vote, has regained some of its power against the dollar in recent months. (It's now valued at about $1.30, up from $1.22 in March.)""This type of broad based decline shows you that it's really people moving away from the dollar, rather than just moving towards these other currencies,"" says Sameer Samana, a global quantitative and technical strategist at Wells Fargo based in St. Louis, Missouri.One reason? Donald Trump.Analysts trace the dollar's surge in the final months of 2016 to his win, which fuelled expectations of tax cuts or infrastructure investment - spending expected to drive demand for the dollar.Now they say the retreat shows traders recalculating, as Mr Trump's economic agenda stalls.An ongoing investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign has cast a shadow over his administration. And alarm over Mr Trump's erratic statements and foreign policy clashes - including with North Korea this week - has also increased.""If people feel like there's greater political uncertainty ... they kind of vote with their dollar,"" says Mr Samana says. Rising interest rates are traditionally linked to stronger currencies, since higher rates attract investment.The US central bank has raised interest rates four times since December 2015, and conventional wisdom calls for another in December. But Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said recently that even supposing future hikes, interest rates are likely to remain historically low for some time.The steady ascent of Janet YellenIMF cuts forecasts for US economic growthUS markets are rising - so why are some people worried?Her caution in part reflects American economic growth that remains humdrum, with inflation and wage growth lagging. ""What's going on now is an expectation that the Fed will continue to be relatively loose in its monetary policy, while the [European Central Bank] starts to tighten,"" says Jeffry Frieden, a professor of government at Harvard University and the author of ""Currency Politics"". ""That is roughly analogous to saying there are expectations that the US will not grow as rapidly as anticipated.""It's tough to know where the dollar is headed next, since at the moment it's neither strongly over- or under-valued, says Jeffrey Frankel, a professor of economics at the Harvard Kennedy School. Richard Marston, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, says he doesn't read too much into the decline, pointing to US stocks over the same period, which soared to new records.""It's not a question of confidence in the US and the US government because that would also affect the equity markets,"" he says. But Mr Frieden says he thinks there is a risk of a free-fall, given disarray in Washington and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve. Ms Yellen's term ends in February and it's not clear whom Mr Trump will name to replace her.""If [the dollar] started really declining in a continual way that seems not to be just random or small fluctuations ... that would indicate a real loss of confidence in the US economy, a real loss of confidence in the US government,"" says Mr Frieden. ""That would be a very bad thing and that would be something that the government had to respond to.""Mr Frankel says he used to predict the dollar would lose its status as an international currency, because of rising national debt and other factors.But that forecast was confounded when investors flocked to the dollar during the economic turmoil of 2008 - even though America was the source of many of the problems.""I finally stopped making that prediction and I'm not ready to switch back,"" he says. ""I think the dollar is still - in some ways even more so - the number one international currency.""Mr Trump isn't worried either.  In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mr Trump said he liked a dollar that's ""not too strong"".""Frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar,"" he said.As an official presidential position, it was a radical statement, since for US consumers - who buy a lot from overseas - a weaker dollar means reduced spending power. The same is true for US manufacturers who rely on parts produced abroad.""The weaker the dollar is, the poorer Americans are on average,"" says Mr Frieden. ""That's not just rhetoric. That's the reality.""But Mr Trump's pro-business administration has focused on reinvigorating US manufacturing and exports, which become cheaper and therefore more competitive globally if the dollar weakens.US firms with global operations also get a boost to their bottom line, as the business overseas becomes more valuable. (That effect contributed to the stock market's rise this year.)Eventually, economic theory predicts a cycle, as more expensive foreign goods increase prices and inflation in the US, prompting the Fed to raise rates - which ultimately boosts the dollar. ""As a tourist, of course I want the dollar to be as strong as possible,"" says Mr Marston. ""As someone who watches the American economy, it's good news."""
"The claim: The US has the highest taxes in the world.Reality Check verdict: The total amount of tax raised by the United States as a proportion of the size of its economy is not the highest in the world. It also does not have the highest rates of taxes on households. By one measure, it does have the highest rate of corporation tax.At a rally in Ohio on Tuesday, President Trump claimed that the US had the highest taxes in the world.A broad measure of the level of taxes is to look at the total amount of tax taken by the government as a percentage of the amount produced by the economy (GDP).The US is clearly not at the top of this list based on figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) covering its own members. The chart below has a selection of them.In 2015, the US tax take came in at 26.4% of GDP, well below countries such as Italy at 43.3%, France at 45.5% and Denmark at 46.6%.So, for overall tax, the US is certainly not the highest. It may be that President Trump was referring to specific taxes. Looking at taxes on individuals, Pew Research looked into tax levels in the US last year and considered the tax rates paid by various types of households with different levels of incomes.It found that US tax bills were below average for developed nations.For high earners, PriceWaterhouse Coopers did some research in 2014, which looked at the G20 countries, and found that someone earning $400,000 (£240,000) in Italy would take home the smallest proportion of their earnings, with the US coming eighth on the list.For the 2017 tax year, the top rate of income tax was 39.6%, affecting single taxpayers whose income exceeds $418,400, or $470,700 for married taxpayers filing jointly.If you look at this list of top tax rates from KPMG, Sweden comes out on top at 61.85%.Turning to corporation tax, the corresponding list from KPMG does put the highest rate for the US at the top (that's 35% federal corporate income tax plus state taxes), with only the United Arab Emirates having a higher rate, which appears to be charged only to foreign oil companies.The US Congress also did a comparison, which found that the US had the highest statutory corporate tax rate in the G20, although looking at the levels companies were actually paying, the US was third on the list of average corporate tax rates and fourth on the list of effective corporate tax rates.Read more from Reality CheckFollow us on Twitter"
"President Donald Trump says the US military is ""locked and loaded"" to deal with North Korea, ramping up the rhetorical brinkmanship.""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong-un will find another path!"" he tweeted.He spoke as Pyongyang accused him of ""driving"" the Korean peninsula to the ""brink of a nuclear war"".North Korea has announced plans to fire missiles near the US territory of Guam.The Pacific island's homeland security agency issued a fact sheet on Friday with tips for residents to prepare for any missile threat.It states: ""Do not look at the flash or fireball - it can blind you.""""Lie flat on the ground and cover your head. If the explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast wave to hit.""Moscow said the exchange of threats between Washington and Pyongyang ""worry us very much"".Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rated the risk of military conflict as ""very high"" as he put forward a joint Russian-Chinese plan to defuse the crisis.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no military solution, and ""an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer.""But later on Friday, at his private golf club in New Jersey, Mr Trump issued further threats to Pyongyang.Asked about his ""locked and loaded"" tweet, he told reporters: ""I hope that they [North Korea] are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said, and what I said is what I mean… those words are very, very easy to understand.""He added: ""If he [Kim Jong-un] utters one threat in the form of an overt threat - which, by the way, he has been uttering for years, and his family has been uttering for years - or if he does anything with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast.""Mr Trump's latest remarks follow his threat earlier this week to rain ""fire and fury"" on Pyongyang.His latest post came hours after his Defence Secretary Jim Mattis attempted to cool tensions by emphasising a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Speaking in California late on Thursday, the Pentagon chief said it was his job to be ready for conflict.But he said the effort by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley ""has diplomatic traction, it is gaining diplomatic results"". Mr Mattis added: ""The tragedy of war is well enough known. It doesn't need another characterisation beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic.""When asked about US military plans for a potential conflict, he said the country was ready, but he would not ""tell the enemy in advance what I'm going to do"".Also on Friday, North Korea's official KCNA news agency accused Washington of a ""criminal attempt to impose nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation"".Pyongyang's media outlet said America was making ""desperate efforts"" to test weapons in the Korean peninsula.The US is ""the mastermind of nuclear threat, the heinous nuclear war fanatic"", the report said.Despite the rhetoric from both sides, the Trump administration has been conducting behind-the-scenes diplomacy with North Korea for several months, the Associated Press news agency reports.Washington has been addressing the issue of Americans detained in the country and escalating tensions on the peninsula, according to AP.Joseph Yun, the US envoy for North Korea, and Pak Song-Il, a senior North Korean diplomat at the UN, are said to be leading the talks.Tensions have risen since North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.The regime was further angered by last week's UN decision to increase economic sanctions against it.North Korea said it was finalising a plan to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based, along with more than 160,000 US citizens.There has been no indication that any actual attack on the Pacific island is imminent.On Thursday Mr Trump suggested that his own statements on North Korea had not been tough enough, warning the regime to be ""very, very nervous"".However, he added that the US would always consider negotiations. He also chided the North's closest ally, China, saying it could do ""a lot more"".China's state-run Global Times newspaper wrote that Beijing should stay neutral if North Korea launches an attack that threatens the US.But it also said that if the US and South Korea attacked North Korea to force regime change, then China must intervene to prevent it. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his nation would be prepared to join a conflict against North Korea if the US came under attack.Australia would honour its commitment under a 1951 treaty, he said, ""as America would come to our aid if we were attacked"".Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"
"President Trump used his ""Make America Great Again"" rally to grab back control of the conversation following criticism from both opponents and supporters.His response to deadly violence in Charlottesville was widely seen as too vague in its condemnation of neo-Nazis, while some supporters have been scathing about his announcement of more US troops for Afghanistan, a commitment he had promised to end.The Arizona rally - unusual for a serving president - was his response.Mr Trump accused journalists of misrepresenting his ""perfect"" words in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was killed after a car ploughed into a crowd of people protesting against far-right demonstrators including neo-Nazis.""For the most part,"" Mr Trump said, ""these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people. And I really think they don't like our country.""""The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news,"" he added, accusing the media of being the ""source of division in this country"".The president then wrongly alleged that US TV networks were ending their live coverage of his speech because he was criticising them.Mr Trump has been accused by right-wing Breitbart news - run by his former chief strategist Steve Bannon - of ""flip-flopping"" on his ""America first"" approach and instead copying Barack Obama's Afghanistan policy.In response he talked up his support for military veterans, said he was increasing defence spending so that troops were well-equipped and said ""every American deserves a government that protects them... and fights for them.""He also said a pro-active approach to foreign policy had led to North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un ""starting to respect the US"".""I respect that fact very much. Respect that fact,"" he said.Mr Trump was at pains to say he wanted a better America for all its citizens, including immigrants.But some of his remarks appeared designed to appeal to those of his supporters who have been accused of being white nationalists.Mr Trump again linked illegal immigration to crime and drugs.""This is like from a different age... These are animals. We are getting them out of here. We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country. We're liberating our towns,"" he said.He hinted at a possible presidential pardon for controversial former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who rose to national prominence because of his tough stance against illegal immigration and was found guilty of  in July over his detention of migrants.And he also made an apparent reference to the removal of Confederate statues - monuments to figures from the slavery-supporting southern states that attempted to secede from the union.Imploring people not to take down statues of former presidents such as George Washington, he echoed the objection of those who do not want Confederate statues removed.""They're trying to take away our culture. They are trying to take away our history,"" he said.No Trump rally is complete without a reference to Mr Trump's proposed barrier on the Mexican border - which he says will keep out illegal immigrants and drug traffickers.""If we have to close down our government, we're building that wall,"" he said.Mr Trump has always insisted Mexico will pay, but has accepted that US taxpayers will have to cover the initial funding and he wants money allocated in the upcoming US budget.If there is no deal on the budget and the debt ceiling then the federal government will shut down, federal employees will not go to work and millions of people will not get paid get paid.A showdown in Washington looms.Mr Trump also said he would ""probably end up terminating Nafta"" - the free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada.Mr Trump made sure to tell his audience that he had not sold out, despite having become president and not yet having turned many of his campaign promises into reality.""I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They're elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great,"" he said.""I think - you know what? I think we're the elites. They're not the elites,"" he added.Later he distanced himself from some commentators' description of his Afghanistan policy speech as ""presidential"".Referring to Senator John McCain's vote against his bid to repeal Obamacare, he said: ""You know, they all said, Mr President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr President don't mention any names. ""So I won't. I won't. No I won't vote - one vote away, I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isn't it? Very presidential.""Mr Trump's preoccupation with the relative numbers of his supporters and opponents at events continued.In the past he has insisted that more people attended his inauguration as president than were at President Obama's.He has also bristled at reminders that while he won the election, a larger number of people overall voted for his opponent Hillary Clinton. In Phoenix he told the crowd that the secret service had informed him that there were ""not too many people outside protesting"".He also said Phoenix had been the location of his first rally speech - ""The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight"".But the Washington Post newspaper reported that some in the crowd lost interest in the president's speech, with ""hundreds"" leaving early and others sitting down and looking at their phones."
"Donald Trump's presidency has had a ""major impact on how the world sees the United States"", a large new study says.The survey, by the Pew Research Center, interviewed more than 40,000 people in 37 countries this year.It concluded that the US president and his policies ""are broadly unpopular around the globe"".The survey shows only two of the 37 countries have a better opinion of Mr Trump than they had of his predecessor Barack Obama: Israel and Russia.But the report indicates many feel their country's relationship with the US will not change over the coming years.The key findings from the survey, carried out between 16 February and 8 May, include:People were surveyed at the end of Barack Obama's eight-year presidency, and after the start of Mr Trump's term - they were asked if they had faith that the president would do the right thing for world affairs.This is how some US allies (and Russia) responded:Mr Trump wasted little time in making his mark on world affairs - making clear he expected Nato countries to pay their fair share and encouraging Gulf countries to isolate Qatar in recent weeks.His presidency has shaken up old allies to the extent that German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, after she met Mr Trump, that she felt Europe could no longer ""completely depend"" on its old ally.In fact, it is among the traditional US allies that the confidence has dropped the most, according to the survey - while 86% of Germans had faith in Mr Obama, for example, only 11% do so in Mr Trump.In his five months in office, the US president has, however, reached out to important friends - visiting Israel, Saudi Arabia and other countries early on.His focus on the relationship with Israel, for one, has paid off - though his preferred status among Israelis is also reflective of Mr Obama's unpopularity there.India, whose prime minister Narendra Modi met Mr Trump on Monday, is one of the countries that looks on the US president most favourably - 40% of respondents had confidence in him compared with 58% for Mr Obama.Read more: The results at the same point in Obama's second termResponders were asked if they viewed Mr Trump in seven particular ways. Here is a sample of answers from three random countries from three continents:""Across all the characteristics tested, positive and negative, President Trump is most likely to be described as arrogant,"" the Pew report says.In 26 of the 37 countries, more than half of respondents consider Mr Trump dangerous.Having said that, the opinion changes depending on who is answering - those who say they are left-leaning are far more likely to consider him dangerous. In Peru and Brazil, it is those in the centre politically who are more likely to be worried.Across the board, Mr Trump is seen as a strong leader - Latin American and African countries in particular really believe this. The downside for him is that very few countries believe he is qualified to be president.The findings were released only hours after the US Supreme Court partially lifted an injunction against President Trump's ban on visitors from six majority-Muslim countries.The ban, which had previously been blocked in lower courts, proved unpopular with 62% of respondents across the 37 countries. A majority of people in only three of the countries - Israel, Hungary and Russia - supported the ban.In countries with large Muslim populations, the ban is unsurprisingly unpopular - with Jordan (disapproval rating of 96%), Lebanon (88%) and Senegal (82%) especially unhappy with the ban.Big win for Trump and his travel banThat's not us saying it, it is the opinion of many of the 40,447 people interviewed by Pew and their associates.People may be worried about what Trump means for their country, many may see him as arrogant or dangerous - but that doesn't mean they think his presidency will have any effect on them.This is not true of everyone of course, but a median of 41% of people think their country's relationship with the US will stay the same.While only 15% think ties will improve, some countries are extremely optimistic, especially in Africa - 54% of Nigerians and 51% Ghanaians think things will get better (as do 53% of Russians, who are generally optimistic about the world with Trump in the White House, according to the survey).The country with the bleakest outlook for their ties with the US? Mexico, by some distance.The survey focused on international attitudes, but a recent report from Pew found that Mr Trump's approval ratings in his home country have remained low since he took office in January.It suggests just 39% of Americans think he is doing a good job - dropping to just 7% among black voters.However, there is still strong support for Mr Trump among his own party: 81% of those who lean or are Republican say he has been doing well, rising to 88% among those who consider themselves more staunchly conservative.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"
"Russia has been ordered to close its San Francisco consulate and two trade missions in response to ""unwarranted"" Russian action, the US has said.The consulate, and annexes in New York and Washington, must close by Saturday.The US state department's move follows Moscow's reduction of US diplomatic staff in Russia last month.That in turn followed new US sanctions on Russia over Crimea and alleged election interference, which led to the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats.President Barack Obama had ordered those expulsions, along with the closure of two compounds, last December.Although Russian President Vladimir Putin did not respond initially to that move, with Mr Trump set to assume office, he then announced on 31 July a reduction of 755 US diplomatic staff in Russia, in retaliation for the US sanctions.The US diplomats expelled have until this Friday to leave Russia - a day before the US closures of the Russian consulate and two annexes, which are trade missions, must be completed.A senior administration official said on Thursday that the consulate and the residence attached to it as well as the two trade missions would close but no Russian staff would be required to leave the country.Russia will be allowed to maintain the properties, but not use them, the official added. The state department said the US actions were ""in the spirit of parity"". It blamed Moscow for what it called a downward spiral in bilateral ties, but suggested it wanted an end to the current spat.""The United States hopes that, having moved toward the Russian Federation's desire for parity, we can avoid further retaliatory actions by both sides and move forward to achieve the stated goal of both our presidents: improved relations between our two countries and increased co-operation on areas of mutual concern,"" state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. The move leaves each country with three consulates in place, Ms Nauert added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Thursday, expressing ""regret at the escalation of tensions in bilateral relations"".He said Moscow would study the order and respond accordingly, according to a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. Mr Lavrov and Mr Tillerson are due to meet in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.Earlier this month, Mr Trump said US relations with Russia were at a ""dangerous low"" amid a row with Congress over the fresh sanctions against Moscow. The president, who wanted warmer ties with Russia, had opposed the bill, which included a provision that limits his ability to lift sanctions and forces him to consult Congress first. Mr Trump has been dogged by claims that Russia tried to sway the election in his favour and several investigations are under way to determine whether anyone from his campaign colluded with Moscow.But the Kremlin has repeatedly denied interfering and Mr Trump has insisted that there was no collusion, calling the investigations a ""witch hunt""."
"North Korea has said it is considering carrying out missile strikes on the US Pacific territory of Guam.The North's official news agency said on Tuesday the plan involved firing medium-to-long-range rockets at Guam, where US strategic bombers are based.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, flying into Guam, said there was no imminent threat from North Korea.He also defended President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"".Mr Tillerson said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he would understand.""I think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime that the US... will defend itself and its allies,"" he said.On Wednesday, Mr Trump tweeted that the US nuclear arsenal was ""more powerful than ever before"", but added he was hopeful ""we will never have to use this power"".The recent exchanges mark a sharp rise in rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang, but China has urged calm.A foreign ministry statement quoted by Reuters called on all sides to avoid words or actions which might escalate the situation and to make greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks.The UN recently approved further economic sanctions on North Korea, which Pyongyang said were a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", warning the US would ""pay a price"".On Wednesday, the official KCNA news agency said North Korea was ""carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam"" using its domestically made medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles.  The news agency reported a military statement issued on Tuesday, which probably came in response to US military drills in Guam.However, there has been no indication that any attack on Guam by North Korea is imminent.In a message to the public, the governor of Guam Eddie Baza Calvo said there was currently ""no threat"" to the island and the Marianas archipelago, but that Guam was ""prepared for any eventuality"".North Korea's statement is the latest stage in a heating up of rhetoric and tension.Pyongyang, which has tested nuclear devices five times, launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit mainland US.On Tuesday, media reports in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.While not confirmed, this was seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state. A report in the Washington Post, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected.A Japanese government defence white paper also said the weapons programme had ""advanced considerably"" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons. North Korea's missile programme explainedIn response, President Trump warned North Korea to stop threatening the US, saying they would be ""met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"".However, veteran US Senator John McCain was sceptical about Mr Trump's statement, saying he was ""not sure that President Trump is ready to act"".On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. ""I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,"" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual.North Korea had reacted angrily after the fresh sanctions were announced on Saturday by the UN, in an attempt to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The sanctions aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third.KCNA said North Korea would retaliate and make ""the US pay a price"" for drafting the new measures.It called the sanctions a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", the news agency said.Meanwhile on Wednesday the UK Foreign Office said it would ""continue to work with the US and our international partners to maintain pressure on North Korea"".""We have been consistently clear and forthright in our condemnation of North Korea's destabilising and illegal behaviour, including through support for UN Security Council resolutions to bring in sanctions that will limit North Korea's ability to pursue its nuclear weapons programme,"" a spokesman said.A spokesman for Germany's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said it was watching the situation ""with the greatest concern"" and called on all sides to use restraint.Guam profile from BBC MonitoringGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"
"The US has said it will use its ""considerable military forces"" on North Korea ""if we must"", following Tuesday's long-range missile test.US ambassador Nikki Haley said a new resolution would also be tabled against Pyongyang at the United Nations.She described the test as a sharp military escalation and also threatened to use trade restrictions.Hours after she spoke, the US and South Korea fired more missiles into the Sea of Japan as part of military drills.But Pyongyang said it would not negotiate unless the US ended its ""hostile policy"" against North Korea. China and Russia also opposed the use of military force.Tuesday's missile launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council.Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and his Japanese counterpart Tomomi Inada said the test was an ""unacceptable provocation"".Gen Mattis said the US was committed to defending Japan and providing deterrence, according to a statement released by the US defence department after their phone call.On Wednesday Ms Haley warned North Korea's test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was ""quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution"".""The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves, and our allies,"" she told an emergency session of the UN Security Council.""One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them, if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction.""On Thursday in South Korea, the US held a joint military drill with the South's troops for a second day in response to the missile test. It involved various destroyers, warships and fighter jets launching guided missiles against a simulated maritime attack, Yonhap news agency reports.'Worst tension since Korean War', says former US envoyMs Haley also said the US could cut off trade with countries which continued to trade with North Korea in violation of UN resolutions.""We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime,"" she said.Earlier, US President Donald Trump criticised China for its trade with North Korea.Mr Trump is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping when they attend a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, where world leaders are expected to discuss the missile test.Why is Donald Trump going to Poland?South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has voiced concern that the North's nuclear and missile development is ""proceeding much faster than expected"".Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, where he met German leader Angela Merkel, he said they would ""examine possibilities of ramping up sanctions"".At the UN Security Council meeting in New York, France's ambassador said it also favoured a new resolution on North Korea to tighten sanctions.Russia, which condemned the test, said the possibility of using military measures ""should be excluded"".China's ambassador Liu Jieyi echoed similar sentiments and said ""military means must not be an option"".He repeated China and Russia's proposal that North Korea should halt its missile and nuclear programmes in exchange for US and South Korean military exercises in the region being frozen. They also propose reversing plans to deploy a controversial anti-missile system in the South.Both Russia and China are permanent members of the UN Security Council and could veto any new resolution.The ""US strategy of strength"" combined with pressure and engagement ""will never work"", state news agency KCNA said.Unless the US stopped its ""hostile policy"", North Korea would ""never put the nuke and ballistic rocket on the negotiating table"".North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was earlier quoted as saying Tuesday's launch was a ""gift"" to the Americans on their independence day, and that he had ordered officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees"".Pyongyang said the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flown 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"".But while experts agree that the test shows Pyongyang has a long-range projectile, many are sceptical that its missiles can successfully deliver warheads.Have North Korea's missile tests paid off?North Korea's missile programme in detail"
"The US Senate has rejected a Republican plan to replace President Barack Obama's signature healthcare policy.The 57-43 vote defeat marks the start of a days-long debate on a sweeping overhaul that critics fear could deny healthcare to millions of Americans. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BRCA) was crafted over two months but attention now turns to other options.President Donald Trump has urged senators to pass a bill, without indicating which one he supports.A repeal-only bill, which would consign so-called Obamacare to history in two years, to give time to Republicans to devise a replacement, could be debated and voted on next.But that measure - which non-partisan analysts say will take health insurance from more than 30 million people - has already failed to win enough support in the Republican party.Other attempts to replace Obamacare have collapsed in recent weeks due to divisions in the party.President Trump had made scrapping the policy a key campaign pledge. He says the system is ""torturing"" Americans. He secured a victory on Tuesday when the Senate agreed to allow the debate on health care legislation reform to go forward, but only after Republican Vice-President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote in support of the bill. Senator John McCain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to Congress to cast his ""Yes"" vote.President Trump tweeted his thanks to the Arizona senator for playing ""such a vital role"" in the vote.But in an early morning tweet on Wednesday, Mr Trump lambasted Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for opposing the Republican plan. The key repeal-and-replace bill, the BCRA, has fallen by the wayside.Next could be a repeal-only bill with a two-year delay, in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses.But senators will also consider a ""skinny bill"", a far narrower measure that would scale back some of the more controversial elements in an effort to get a wider consensus. A special Senate-House of Representatives committee would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still see changes during negotiations.If successful, the full House and Senate would again have to approve the measure. US Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told CNBC on Wednesday that Senate Republicans should aim for the ""lowest common denominator"" to secure the 50 votes need to pass a bill. Republicans have long railed against Obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party's proposed alternative includes steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled.And it removes Obamacare's individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.About 20 million people gained health insurance under former President Obama's Affordable Care Act. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade.If Republican senators elect to repeal key provisions of the law without immediately replacing it, the CBO estimates about 32 million consumers would lose insurance over the next 10 years.

"Russia has retaliated to new US sanctions by telling Washington to cut its diplomatic staff to 455 and barring the use of some properties.The new US embassy staffing level would be the same as at Russia's embassy in Washington.The Russian foreign ministry also said it was seizing holiday properties and a warehouse used by US diplomats.The new US sanctions are over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and alleged interference in the US election.They come months after the Obama administration ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign.In a statement on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry said: ""The US is stubbornly taking one crudely anti-Russian step after another, using the utterly fictitious pretext of Russian interference in its internal affairs.""The US expulsion of Russian diplomats ""clearly violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and generally accepted diplomatic norms"", it added.It was not immediately clear how many diplomats and staff members would have to stop working at the embassy, but Russian news agencies quoted sources as saying ""hundreds"" of people would be affected.Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed US embassy official as saying the embassy employed about 1,100 diplomatic and support staff in Russia, including US and Russian citizens.Russia also said it would respond in kind if Washington decided to expel any more Russian diplomats.Russia's move comes a day after President Vladimir Putin decried what he called ""anti-Russian hysteria"" in Washington.The new US sanctions on Russia were overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Congress despite objections from the Trump White House.US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Trump and now there are several investigations looking into whether anyone from his campaign helped.Russia has always denied interfering and Mr Trump insists there was no collusion."
"North Korea has vowed to retaliate and make ""the US pay a price"" for drafting fresh UN sanctions over its banned nuclear weapons programme. The sanctions, which were unanimously passed by the UN on Saturday, were a ""violent violation of our sovereignty,"" the official KCNA news agency said.Separately, South Korea says the North has rejected an offer to restart talks, dismissing it as insincere. The sanctions will aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third.The UN Security Council decision followed repeated missile tests by the North which have escalated tensions on the peninsula.In its first major response on Monday, North Korea insisted that it would continue to develop its controversial nuclear weapons programme.The state-run KCNA news agency said Pyongyang would ""not put our self-defensive nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table"" while it faces threats from the US.It threatened to make the US ""pay the price for its crime... thousands of times,"" referring to America's role in drafting the UN sanctions resolution.Speaking to reporters at a regional forum in the Philippine capital, Manila, North Korean spokesman Bang Kwang Hyuk said: ""The worsening situation on the Korean peninsula, as well as the nuclear issues, were caused by the United States.""We affirm that we'll never place our nuclear and ballistic missiles programme on the negotiating table, and won't budge an inch on strengthening nuclear armament.""The remarks come after reports emerged that the North and South Korean foreign ministers had met briefly on Sunday evening on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Manila. South Korean media reported that its Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung-wha, shook hands with her North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, in a brief and unarranged meeting at an official dinner event.A South Korean official told the BBC that Mr Ri had dismissed Ms Kang's offer of talks as ""insincere"".South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Ms Kang as saying that Mr Ri's rejection of the talks proposal appeared to be connected to the new sanctions. ""I told him that [the two offers for talks] are an urgent matter that should be carried out immediately with any political agenda put aside and asked him to proactively react,"" she was quoted as saying.The foreign minister of China, which is Pyongyang's closest ally, told journalists on Monday: ""My feeling is that the North did not entirely reject the positive proposals raised by the South."" Wang Yi added that China also supported the South's initiatives, and was ""100%"" committed to enforcing the latest round of UN sanctions.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also at the Asean forum, where he spoke about North Korea.Noting Russia and China's participation in the unanimous vote, he told journalists it was clear there was now ""no daylight among the international community"" on their desire for North Korea to stop its tests.""The best signal that North Korea can give us [is] that they are prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches,"" he added.Russia and China have previously differed with others on how to handle Pyongyang, but in recent months have joined calls for North Korea to stop its missile tests - while also urging the US and South Korea to halt military drills, and withdraw an anti-missile system from the South.Meanwhile, the US military has said it is working with its close ally South Korea to review guidelines covering the size of missile warheads that South Korea can deploy.The current bilateral guidelines limit the power of South Korean missiles, but Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis said these restrictions might be altered.""It is a topic under active consideration here and I would tell you that we would be favourably inclined to do anything which furthers the defensive capabilities of South Korea,"" he told reporters. ""We will always adapt to the threat as it changes.""On Monday, US President Donald Trump spoke to his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in over the phone about relations on the Korean peninsula.They agreed that North Korea ""poses a grave and growing direct threat"" and the two leaders were committed to fully implementing the latest round of UN sanctions, the White House said in a statement."
"After weeks of tough talk and escalating tensions between the US and North Korea, President Donald Trump has referred to the possibility of meeting his opposite number, Kim Jong Un. Let's take a step back and look at how we got here. The threat perception: The Americans believe that Pyongyang already has the technology to fire nuclear warheads at Japan and South Korea. And they calculate that it will likely be able to hit the United States within a few years. So North Korea is now seen as a threat to US national security, not only a menace to regional allies. Hence the sense of urgency and resolve. The rhetoric: Military options have always ""been on the table"", sometimes more actively than others. But rarely if ever has a US administration been as blunt or outspoken about it. That is largely a factor of President Trump's style but it's also due to growing concern about the imminence of the threat. The military posturing: Spring is usually a tense time in the Korean Peninsula, because North Korea celebrates a number of patriotic anniversaries that can serve as launch pads for weapons tests, and the US conducts military exercises with Seoul. But this year the Trump administration added to the firepower on display, including a submarine equipped with guided missiles, and an aircraft carrier group. The confusion over the deployment of the latter, however, may have detracted somewhat from its deterrent effect. North Korea: Pyongyang has long held that it needs nuclear weapons to guarantee its security, and has been ready to face down international censure and punishment. But Kim Jong Un has shown particular determination and, unlike his father and grandfather, a disregard for the views of his only major ally, China. ""Kim Jong Il for all of his sins at least cared what other people thought and particularly cared what the Chinese thought,"" the former US negotiator Chris Hill told the BBC. ""His son Kim Jung Un doesn't seem to care what anyone thinks.""China: China is exasperated by its recalcitrant ally and worried about the growing sophistication of its weapons. It had already begun tightening its implementation of sanctions by following through with the UN's recent ban on coal imports. But it's probably even more worried that Trump's military posturing will escalate tensions, and uneasy about his insistence that Beijing is uniquely positioned to squeeze Pyongyang. In an apparent response to US pressure, Chinese newspapers have published tougher statements about North Korea. There's also been closer coordination between Beijing and Washington.The Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says Beijing has threatened Pyongyang with unilateral sanctions if it carries out a sixth nuclear test.The options: There are still no good ones. Tillerson says denuclearisation would still be the goal, but he has not been precise about conditions for starting talks.The strategy: Actually, it has sort of changed and sort of hasn't. The administration says it has. But the components - pressing for tighter economic sanctions, urging China to lean on its neighbour, and waiting for North Korea to buckle - look a lot like Barack Obama's ""strategic patience"". The difference seems to be less patience, a more credible threat of military force, and more coercive diplomacy. Tillerson says the knob on the pressure campaign is at ""five or six"" right now, with the US ""testing"" Beijing's ability to influence North Korea, and threatening to sanction parties that violate the UN embargo. Alongside China, the Trump administration is also trying to convince South East Asian nations to isolate North Korea. China: China may be more willing to turn the screws on Pyongyang, but only so far. There is no sign that it has changed its calculation of North Korea as a buffer state. Beijing fears that if the regime collapses the American security umbrella will be extended across the peninsula right to its borders. And while North Korea is a dangerous headache, America is its biggest strategic rival. Tillerson's recent assurance that the US is not seeking regime change was aimed as much at Beijing as it was at Pyongyang.The wild card: Even with a nuclear rogue state, President Trump likes to be unpredictable. And his tactics are those of a deal maker. Nevertheless observers are struggling to interpret the contrast between his hardline rhetoric and his recent suggestion of a meeting with Kim Jong Un - under the ""right circumstances"" .Barack Obama also said during the 2008 election campaign he'd be willing to meet the North Korean leader. But he did not go on to praise his adversary as did Trump, calling him a ""smart cookie"" for holding onto power by wiping out his rivals. It's not clear if the president was deliberately dangling a carrot, making another overture among several to a strongman, or simply throwing an offhand comment into the mix."
"Russian hackers targeted election systems in 21 US states during last year's campaign, said a US official.Jeanette Manfra of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refused to identify the states during her testimony before a Senate panel, citing confidentiality agreements.But she added there was no evidence to suggest actual vote ballots were altered in the election hack. US intelligence agencies believe Moscow interfered to help Donald Trump win.Ms Manfra, the department's acting deputy undersecretary of cyber security, testified on Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence committee, which is investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election. ""As of right now, we have evidence that election-related systems in 21 states were targeted,"" she told the panel. She said DHS still had confidence in the US voting system because they are ""fundamentally resilient"". The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement in election cyber hacks while Mr Trump has dismissed allegations that his campaign colluded with Russia as ""fake news"". White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday refused to say whether Mr Trump believes Russia interfered in the 2016 election. ""I have not sat down and talked to him about that specific thing,"" Mr Spicer said during a daily news briefing. ""Obviously we've been dealing with a lot of other issues today. I'd be glad to touch base.""Senator Mark Warner, a top Democrat on the panel, argued on Wednesday the country was ""not any safer"" in concealing which states were hit in the hack. Both Arizona and Illinois last year confirmed that their voter registration systems had been attacked by hackers. Republican Senator Marco Rubio also expressed concern, adding that as the investigation continues ""it is important Americans understand how our voting systems work and communicate that in real time"". Ms Manfra's comments echoed earlier testimony by Samuel Liles, acting director of the DHS cyber division. Mr Liles told Congress DHS detected hacking activities last spring and summer and later received reports of cyber probing of election systems. But he added: ""None of these systems were involved in vote tallying.""Mr Liles also said ""a small number of networks were exploited - they made it through the door."""
"On Wednesday morning, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd issued a stern rebuke to the US government for leaking the name of the suspect in the Manchester bombing to American news outlets before UK authorities were prepared to make it public.She might as well have been shaking her fist at a cloud, for all the good it did. By Wednesday evening, not only had the US media divulged more details of the investigation - information on Salman Abedi's family and his international travels - the New York Times printed close-up photographs of fragments of the Manchester bomb and the apparent tattered remains of the backpack that held it.British officials have gone from irritated to furious, and Manchester police began withholding further details of the attack from US intelligence out of concern that the leaks are tipping off suspects and impeding its investigation.The porous nature of the US government - its inability to protect sensitive information - may come as a shock to the international community, but in the US it's just another day at the proverbial office.During the 2016 campaign, the FBI leaked a crescendo of damaging details about its investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the days leading up to the presidential election. Since then, the intelligence community has been a sieve of unflattering information about President Donald Trump, including sharing embarrassing accounts of his interaction with foreign leaders and the communications of his advisers. Although it was overshadowed by the nature of the revelations, the fact that the contents of intercepted phone conversations between Trump adviser Michael Flynn and a Russian ambassador made the front page of the New York Times was an extraordinary violation of surveillance protocols.Then there are the leaks that have originated within the Trump administration itself, as rival factions share pointed details about the internal machinations of the White House in a scramble to gain favour with the president. And while not technically a leak, the (leaked) news that Mr Trump himself revealed sensitive information to a Russian delegation in the Oval Office reportedly given to the US by Israeli intelligence has contributed to the growing sense that the US government is dysfunctional, at best. Until recently it was a condition Americans had largely kept to themselves. Now US allies are part of the game. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningAll this comes as the Trump administration is pressing for increased co-operation between the US and European allies, including the UK, to counter extremist violence and combat the so-called Islamic State. That includes a recently announced Nato plan to create a new intelligence-sharing division and an anti-terrorism ""fusion cell"".For the moment all the parties who are talking - on and off the record - say that this episode won't affect US efforts to foster greater international collaboration or threaten the US-UK ""special relationship"".Mr Trump, in a statement released to the media, called the leaks ""deeply troubling"" and re-emphasised the strength of the US-UK alliance.""There is no relationship we cherish more than the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,"" he said.Follow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.The thing about leaks is they're usually put out for a reason. The ongoing feud between Mr Trump and the intelligence community helps explain why US media have had a string of explosive stories about Mr Trump and the Russian investigation over the past few weeks. It's easy to see who profits and suffers from whatever bits of White House palace intrigue splash across the front pages on a near daily basis.The Manchester leaks, however, are a bit more difficult to peg. Who, exactly, benefits? Some of the leaks have been attributed to ""intelligence sources"" others to ""police officials"", which doesn't narrow things down much.The leaks are certainly an embarrassment for the Trump administration, making his team appear unable to run a tight ship at a time when he's taking his first turn on the world stage.On the other hand, this will bolster the president's efforts to paint the leaks that have bedevilled his White House as a threat to national security, hindering the US ability to fight militant extremists. Mr Trump has complained that the intelligence community hasn't taken the onslaught of leaks seriously over the past few months. Perhaps it will now.""These leaks have been going on for a long time, and my administration will get to the bottom of this,"" Mr Trump said in his statement. ""I am asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review of this matter, and if appropriate, the culprit should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""There may be someone in the US government who thinks these revelations could pressure the UK to take more aggressive steps of its own to address what Mr Trump in the past has termed ""radical Islamic terrorism"".Then there's the possibility that the leaks are merely one person's attempt to gain favour with a reporter or burnish his or her reputation as a knowledgeable insider. If there's one lesson to be learned from the past year, it's there is often no need to look for complex explanations when simple individual pride or incompetence fits the bill. Whatever the explanation, officials in both the UK and the US say the Manchester leaks are going to stop.UK officials said on Thursday evening they had resumed sharing information with the US after receiving ""fresh assurances"" from across the Atlantic.The question is what happens the next time. And the time after that.""At the moment we have a US administration and US intelligence agencies all leaking like sieves, so I'm afraid this is the reason why this has happened,"" says former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer. ""Will it destroy our close co-operation with the Americans? Of course not, because if it didn't exist it would have to be invented. But this is a serious knock. It is a serious dent.""Intelligence sharing, British Prime Minister Theresa May said, is built on trust. Trust typically doesn't vanish in an instant, it erodes slowly, imperceptibly. And then it's gone."
"The US secretary of state has warned Russia's foreign minister of ""serious mistrust"" between the two nations due to Moscow's US election interference.Rex Tillerson said Russia's actions had damaged the relationship, but added it's not ""useful to just cut everything off over one single issue"".The US will respond by 1 September to Russia's expulsion of 755 staff from the US embassy in Moscow, he said.US intelligence agencies believe the Kremlin tried to help Donald Trump.Moscow vehemently denies any efforts to influence the US election, and retaliatory sanctions passed by Congress last month - against President Trump's wishes - have sparked a tit-for-tat.Mr Tillerson told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov there was now ""serious mistrust between our two countries and that we simply have to find some way to deal with that"".After speaking to Mr Lavrov on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting in the Philippines, he said: ""We have our differences, we're going to have to continue to find a way to address those."" He said he met Mr Lavrov to ""help them understand how serious this incident had been and how seriously it damaged the relationship.""  Mr Tillerson also indicated that the two countries may be able to come together to begin discussions on violence in Eastern Ukraine.The comments by the former CEO of Exxon Mobil come less than a week after US President Donald Trump signed into law the new legislation that imposes sanctions on Russia for both election meddling and military actions in Crimea and Ukraine.The law also prevents Mr Trump from lifting sanctions or returning Russian diplomatic compounds in the US that were seized by the Obama administration in retaliation for the alleged meddling.The president has failed to singularly point the finger at Moscow for the hacking of Democratic Party emails during the final stages of the election campaign.And he has condemned the investigations, which are also looking at whether his campaign team colluded with Moscow, as a witch hunt.After signing the bill, Mr Trump decried it, arguing that it limited his ability to negotiate with Russia."
"The US is looking for a ""major"" overhaul of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), a senior US trade official said as negotiations on the pact got underway.Mexico and Canada defended the deal on Wednesday in the first day of talks to revise the trade agreement.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said President Trump wanted changes beyond just updating the pact.Talks between the three countries are expected to last for months.""He is not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions and a couple of updated chapters,"" Mr Lighthizer said in his opening remarks in Washington. ""We feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement.""The Nafta talks came as President Trump suffered a setback with some of the biggest US companies over his handling of violent clashes in Virginia.Two key White House business advisory councils were disbanded on Wednesday after several bosses quit over how Mr Trump reacted to the far-right rally last weekend.Renegotiating Nafta was a major campaign theme for Mr Trump, who has described it as the ""worst deal"". He blames it for the loss of US manufacturing jobs, a position that struck a chord with many voters. Mexico's Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said he was not surprised or deterred by Mr Lighthizer's tough posture, which is in line with earlier US statements.The US will be seeking changes such as stronger labour provisions and stricter rules of origin, which determine where companies can say a product is made. That measure is opposed by US automakers.The US also wants to revamp the Nafta panels used to resolve disputes.Canada maintains that those panels - which have rejected US complaints in the past for industries such as softwood lumber - are critical.""It's fundamental because the commerce department [in the US] takes a lot of measures and countervailing duties which sometimes are unjust and not founded, like in softwood lumber,"" Raymond Bachand, one of the Nafta negotiators on the Canadian side, told the BBC. ""Through that mechanism - which is much faster than the WTO mechanism - we win and these decisions are reversed. So they're fundamental.""All three sides say there is an opportunity to ""modernise"" the agreement to reflect new technology and online business. Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, shared a photo of the talks on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon, saying it had been a ""productive discussion ... on the mutually beneficial economic relationship between Canada and the US""."
"A top general has told Canadian MPs they cannot count on US support if North Korea launches a nuclear attack on their country.Lt Gen Pierre St-Amand told the national defence committee in Ottawa there is no policy that requires the US to aid Canada in any nuclear attack.But on the upside, the committee also heard North Korea views Canada as a ""peaceful"" and ""friendly"" country.Pyongyang's missile launch over Japan on Friday has put the region on edge.Gen St-Amand told MPs: ""The extent of the US policy is not to defend Canada. ""That's the fact I can bring to the table.""Canada has long avoided joining the US ballistic missile defence programme, under the assumption that the US would shoot down a nuclear missile heading for its northern neighbour anyway.But Lt Gen St-Amand's testimony suggested otherwise.However, Mark Gwozdecky, assistant deputy minister for international security, said all evidence suggested Canada was not in North Korea's crosshairs. ""There's been no direct threat to Canada,"" Mr Gwozdecky told the meeting.""In fact, on the contrary, in recent contacts with the North Korean government, including in August when our national security adviser was in Pyongyang, the indications were they perceived Canada as a peaceful and indeed a friendly country.""Mr Gwozdecky stressed that even if Canada was not a target, North Korea still posed a serious threat to global peace and security."
"The US attorney general has said four people have been charged over leaks as the Trump administration launched a crackdown on embarrassing disclosures.Jeff Sessions said the suspects were accused of divulging classified material or concealed contacts with foreign intelligence officers.America's top prosecutor said the administration has tripled the number of active leak probes since January.President Donald Trump has criticised Mr Sessions as ""very weak"" on leaks.At Friday's news conference, the attorney general said no government could be effective when its leaders could not talk freely in confidence with foreign leaders.""I strongly agree with the president and condemn in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country,"" he told reporters.He said there had been a ""dramatic"" increase in recent months of unauthorised disclosures to the media and even foreign adversaries.The attorney general also said he wanted to review policies on media subpoenas - compelling journalists to reveal sources - to balance the role of the press with protecting national security.The move is likely to send a chill through US newsrooms that have been breaking almost daily scoops, which have embarrassed the White House.Jeff Sessions spoke about the Justice Department's efforts to crack down on national security leaks before television cameras and reporters, but his intended audience was almost certainly the man in the Oval Office.Last week the president lambasted his attorney general for not doing enough to stifle a torrent of leaks over the past six months. On Friday morning Mr Sessions essentially replied: ""See? I am doing something!""What's more, the attorney general served his anti-leak entree with a generous helping of media-bashing, warning that while he respected freedom of the press, he was reviewing when prosecutors could force journalists to reveal their sources - or face criminal sanction. That's a dish specially crafted for the president's tastes.Earlier this week, newly minted chief of staff John Kelly reportedly called Mr Sessions and told him that, despite the president's recent swipes, his job was safe. Perhaps Friday's event is part of a larger effort at fence-mending between the commander-in-chief and his former political confidant.The attorney general will have to deliver results, however. If he can't stop the leaks, it is doubtful the president will be satisfied. And if there's one truth in Washington, it's that the leaks never really stop.Follow @awzurcher ‏Mr Sessions was joined by Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who issued a stark warning to leakers.""Anyone who engages in these criminal acts is betraying the intelligence community and the American people,"" he said.""We feel the pain of those betrayals intensely and I can assure you that I will do everything in my power as director of national intelligence to hold those people accountable.""Understand this, if you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you, we will investigate you, and we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law, and you will not be happy with the result.""Only this week transcripts of rancorous calls between President Trump and foreign leaders surfaced in the Washington Post..The US leader told Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that the US state of New Hampshire was ""a drug-infested den"".On the line to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Trump referred to himself as ""the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country"".He also complained it was ""the most unpleasant call all day"".Mr Sessions did not share details of the four leak arrests.But in June a 25-year-old National Security Agency contractor, Reality Winner, was arrested for removing classified material from a federal site in the state of Georgia.The American Civil Liberties Union said ""a crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy as a whole"".Spokesman Ben Wizner said: ""Our founders understood that democracy depends on an informed citizenry, and leaders can't be trusted to disclose vital information that reflects poorly on themselves. ""These first months of the Trump administration dramatically illustrate that point."""
"Four companies have been chosen to build prototypes for Donald Trump's planned border wall, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said.The four concrete prototypes will be 30ft (9m) long and up to 30ft tall, and will be built in the coming months.Officials will then spend up to two months testing the walls for tampering and penetration resistance using small hand tools, CBP said.The four contracts are worth up to $500,000 (£387,000) each.A continuous wall across the entire southern US border was a key promise in President Trump's election campaign.The prototypes ""will help us refine the design standards"" of the eventual wall, acting CBP deputy commissioner Ronald Vitiello said.""Testing will look at things like the aesthetics of it, how penetrable they are, how resistant they are to tampering, and scaling or anti-climb features.""But he said the officials would stick to small hand tools rather than testing ""ballistic kind of things"".The walls will also need to feature cable conduits and other design features for sensors and cameras.Once the order to start building is given in the next few weeks, the prototypes are expected to be finished within 30 days.The four companies to which the contracts were awarded are:Mr Vitiello said he did not know if any of the firms had had prior experience in border wall construction.More than 200 companies are believed to have submitted designs for the proposed border wall.Four more contracts for prototypes made from materials other than concrete will be announced next week.

"The US and China have wrapped up contentious trade talks in Washington without agreement.  The two sides did not issue a joint statement or action plan after the meeting and cancelled scheduled press conferences. The US was critical of China's trade surplus and demanded ""more fair"" trade arrangements. Separately, US President Donald Trump indicated that tariffs on Chinese steel were still a possibility.     In his opening remarks to the annual US-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross criticised China's $347bn (£266bn) trade surplus with the US, saying it was not the product of market forces.  In a brief statement after the talks, Mr Ross and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offered few details and little indication of any progress on contentious issues.""China acknowledged our shared objective to reduce the trade deficit which both sides will work cooperatively to achieve,"" the statement said.The contentious issue of steel tariffs was expected to be a difficult topic at the talks, but the two sides did not issue any statements on this.The US blames Chinese excess capacity for a global steel glut that is hurting US producers, and has threatened to impose tariffs.  US Steel stocks were sharply higher as investors interpreted silence on the issue as an increased likelihood of US action on Chinese steel. After the market closed, President Donald Trump told a reporter that steel tariffs ""could happen"", according to Reuters news agency.Experts thought it was unlikely that the talks would produce any significant agreements on the most thorny issues. In addition to steel, the US was expected to push Beijing on its subsidies for state-owned enterprises. China was expected to focus on US refusals to sell Beijing advanced technology products.It was unclear whether the talks covered US demands for China to put more pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and missile program. Mr Trump has previously signalled that China might obtain improved trade terms in exchange for help on North Korea.In May, the US and China reached a trade deal that opens the Chinese market to US credit rating agencies and credit card companies.China also agreed to lift its ban on US beef imports and accept US shipments of liquefied natural gas.

"The White House has set new criteria for visa applicants from six mainly Muslim countries and all refugees, requiring them to have a ""close"" family or business tie to the US. The rules, affecting people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, are coming into force on Thursday.They were issued after the Supreme Court partially restored President Donald Trump's travel ban on Monday.The executive order had been blocked by lower courts since February.The revised rules - taking conditions laid out in the Supreme Court ruling - come into effect at 20:00 Washington time (00:00 GMT).According to the new rules, confirmed to the BBC, for the next 90 days those from the six countries without a close relationship will not be able to enter the US.Those considered to have a close relationship under the policy include a parent, spouse, child, son or daughter-in-law, or sibling, including step- or half-siblings. Excluded are grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, in-laws, extended family and grandchildren.Also exempt from the new rules are those with business or educational ties to the US. However, the guidelines specifically state that the relationship must be formal, documented and not formed for the purpose of evading the order.Those who already hold valid visas are not affected. Dual nationals who travel on their passport from the unaffected country will also be allowed entry.The Supreme Court said in Monday's decision that it would make a final ruling on the executive order in October.But in the meantime, it added, the order ""may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States"".The court also approved the 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who do not have any ""bona fide relationship"" with an American individual or entity.President Trump called the court's decision a ""victory for our national security. He said the order was needed to stop terrorists entering the US, but critics said it was a ban on Muslims.Lawyers on both sides of the argument have warned that the new restrictions could open the door to a flood of legal challenges.In particular, the exact meaning of the phrase ""bona fide"" was expected to come under scrutiny.Meanwhile, a number of activist groups have promised to help people caught up in the ban. The New York Immigration Coalition says it plans to be at the city's John F Kennedy International Airport to ""monitor the effects of Trump's revised Muslim and refugee ban"".But so far, the order does not appear to have had too big an impact on travellers.A spokesman form Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline, said on Thursday: ""Our flights to the US are operating as per normal. All passengers must possess the appropriate travel documents, including a valid US entry visa, in order to travel.""Will you be affected by the travel ban?

"The US government is not seeking a regime change in North Korea, the secretary of state says, amid tensions over Pyongyang's weapons programme. ""We're not your enemy,"" Rex Tillerson said, adding that the US wanted a dialogue at some point.But a Republican senator said President Donald Trump had told him there would be a war with North Korea if its missile programme continued.Pyongyang claimed its latest missile could hit the US west coast.The second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Friday, celebrated by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was the latest to be conducted in defiance of a United Nations ban.""We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel,"" said Mr Tillerson, referring to the border between the Koreas. ""We're not your enemy, we're not your threat but you're presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond.""Barbara Plett Usher, US state department correspondentNorth Korea's recent long-range missile tests have deepened concern about the threat Pyongyang poses to the US mainland, and strengthened determination here to prevent any strike. That's what the president had in mind in his war talk with Senator Lindsey Graham. The Pentagon has updated military options, but at the same time says a confrontation would be catastrophic. In light of that, Mr Tillerson repeated at length that the US wasn't seeking regime change and said the goal was dialogue, but one not based on the assumption that North Korea could keep its nuclear weapons. Pyongyang has categorically refused such terms. The strategy, said Mr Tillerson, is a sustained campaign of peaceful but intensifying economic pressure to change its mind. But given the advances in ballistic technology demonstrated by the recent ICBM tests, there's growing doubt that denuclearisation is a realistic possibility. As always, there are no good options when it comes to North Korea, but less time to pursue them.President Trump has repeatedly criticised China, which shares a land border with North Korea and is its closest economic ally, for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme.However, Mr Tillerson took a more diplomatic approach, saying that ""only the North Koreans are to blame for this situation"".""But,"" he added, ""we do believe China has a special and unique relationship, because of this significant economic activity, to influence the North Korean regime in ways that no one else can.""In a separate development, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that Mr Trump told him that there would be a military conflict between the two countries if Pyongyang continued with its aim to develop a missile programme with the US in its range.""There will be a war with North Korea over their missile programme if they continue to try to hit America with an ICBM,"" Mr Graham said.""He [Trump] has told me that, I believe him, and if I were China I would believe him too, and do something about it,"" he said in an interview with NBC's Today programme.Mr Graham added: ""If there's going to be a war... it will be over there. If thousands die, they're going to die over there. They're not going to die here. And he [Trump] has told me that to my face.""Despite the ongoing tests, most experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target.They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets.Others, however, believe that at the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US.

"US President Donald Trump has thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering the departure of 755 staff from US diplomatic missions.Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, he said he wanted to thank the Russian leader for saving the US money.Several US investigations are looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which allegedly meddled in the 2016 election.Mr Trump has rejected the inquiries as a ""witch hunt"".At the end of July, President Putin said 755 staff would have to leave US diplomatic missions in Russia, in retaliation for new US sanctions against Moscow. Many employees are believed to be ""local hires"", meaning it is likely far less than 755 people will actually have to leave the country.He said they had to leave by 1 September, bringing staff levels to 455, the same as Russia's complement in Washington.Staff in the embassy in Moscow as well as the consulates in Ekaterinburg, Vladivostok and St Petersburg were affected.At the time, the US State Department said the move was a ""regrettable and uncalled for act"".But Mr Trump thanked Mr Putin for reducing the US government's ""payroll"".""I want to thank him because we're trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I'm concerned I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people,"" he said.Also on Thursday, President Trump said he was ""very surprised"" by raids on the Virginia home of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort by federal agents on 26 July.Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading up the main investigation into Russian election interference, left Mr Manafort's Alexandria home with ""various records"", the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.The president, who is on a working holiday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, also told reporters he had not thought about the possibility of firing Mr Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel in May following Mr Trump's sacking of then FBI Director James Comey."
"The US says it will not call for a UN Security Council meeting over North Korea's missile tests because it would produce ""nothing of consequence"".Such a meeting would send a message to North Korea that the international community was unwilling to challenge it, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said.Pyongyang said its tests proved that the entire US was within range.The US has responded by testing an anti-missile system and flying bombers over the Korean peninsula.On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump and they agreed on the need for further action on North Korea given its most recent missile test on Friday. The two did not discuss any use of military action.Ms Haley said in a statement that North Korea was already subject to numerous Security Council resolutions that they ""flout with impunity"".""An additional Security Council resolution that does not significantly increase the international pressure on North Korea is of no value,"" she said. ""In fact it is worse than nothing because it sends the message to the North Korean dictator that the international community is unwilling to seriously challenge him.""She urged China to rein in North Korea.""China must decide whether it is finally willing to take this vital step. The time for talk is over,"" she added.On Friday, North Korea test-fired a second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), claiming it proved that the entire US was within striking range.The launch came three weeks after the state's first ICBM test.Despite fierce objections from China, the US military recently began installing missile defences - the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system - in South Korea, with the aim of shooting down any North Korean missiles fired in conflict.On Sunday, the US military said a test of the Thaad equipment in Alaska had successfully brought down a projectile fired by the US Air Force over the Pacific. US B-1 bombers also conducted exercises over the Korean peninsula with South Korean and Japanese planes on Sunday.'Spoiled child'US President Donald Trump has again criticised China for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme while making ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" in trade with the US. Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he was ""very disappointed"" with China, adding that he would not allow it to ""do nothing"" about the isolated state.Victor Gao, a former diplomat and Chinese government adviser, said Mr Trump's comments were unhelpful, adding that the US was acting like a ""spoiled child"". China, which shares a land border with North Korea and is its closest economic ally, earlier condemned the North's test launch and urged restraint on all sides.Mr Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed North Korea earlier this year, after which US officials said they were working together on ""a range of options"".But South Korea said Friday's ICBM launch demonstrated a defiance from the North, showcasing ""a significant advancement in technology"".1.

"White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is the latest top aide of President Donald Trump to leave his post.Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Friday was his last day. His exit follows a review of his position by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.Mr Bannon, who helped shape Mr Trump's ""America First"" campaign message, is returning as head of Breitbart.com, and says he will remain loyal.The 63-year-old is executive chairman of the website, which has been accused of voicing anti-Semitic and white supremacist views.In another departure from Mr Trump's team, billionaire investor Carl Icahn announced he was ending his role as the president's special advisor on regulatory reform, after facing criticism that his advice could benefit his own businesses.Mr Bannon is known to have competed for influence in the West Wing against more moderate factions, including members of the Trump family.He told the Bloomberg TV network: ""I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents - on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America."" Mr Trump raised eyebrows earlier this year when he elevated Mr Bannon to the National Security Council, the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs.But he was subsequently removed from the council in a move that was seen as a sign of National Security Adviser HR McMaster's growing influence over the president.  Mr Bannon has reportedly feuded with Mr McMaster as well as Gary Cohn, the director of the president's National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs chief viewed as a globalist. Mr Cohn, along with President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter, Ivanka Trump, were viewed as threats to Mr Bannon's White House agenda. Steve Bannon may be out as a senior White House adviser, but Bannonism - if that's what it can properly be called - is still firmly entrenched in the White House.Donald Trump has repeatedly boasted that the success of his presidential campaign should properly be attributed to him, not Mr Bannon. And, in the end, Mr Bannon's desire to take credit for that win may have been what did him in.It certainly wasn't because of any sharp ideological divides between the president and the former head of Breitbart News.Border security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - all were themes that Mr Trump ran on from the start, which Mr Bannon only sharpened and focused. They're also issues Mr Trump has pushed in recent weeks, even as Mr Bannon has been increasingly marginalised.Mr Bannon's firing will be seen as a win for Chief of Staff John Kelly, whose attempts to instil discipline in the White House will get a boost without the free-wheeling Mr Bannon roaming the hallways.Trump was Trump before Mr Bannon came on the scene, however. And as the rollercoaster ride that was politics this week indicates, the president isn't changing anytime soon.Mr Trump fuelled speculation when asked last week about Mr Bannon's future as he replied: ""We'll see.""Mr Bannon's interview this week with the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, reportedly infuriated the president.The White House aide was quoted as dismissing the idea of a military solution in North Korea, undercutting Mr Trump.He told the magazine the US was ""at economic war with China"" and that he aimed to push out moderates whom he believed were soft on China. Mr Bannon told associates he thought it was an off-the-record chat and did not realise he would be quoted.He has pushed for imposing additional tariffs on China and other trade partners to reduce deficits with those countries.He also advocated for a travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries. Ms Huckabee Sanders' statement said: ""White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. ""We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.""

"President Donald Trump has warned North Korea it should be ""very, very nervous"" if it does anything to the US. He said the regime would be in trouble ""like few nations have ever been"" if they do not ""get their act together"". His comments came after Pyongyang announced it had a plan to fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam.US Defence Secretary James Mattis warned that armed conflict with North Korea would be ""catastrophic"" and said diplomacy was bearing fruit.""The American effort is diplomatically led, it has diplomatic traction, it is gaining diplomatic results,"" he said.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said his country is fully prepared to join a war against North Korea, were it to launch an attack on the US.""If there's an attack on the US, the Anzus Treaty would be invoked and Australia would come to the aid of the United States,"" he said in a radio interview, ""as America would come to our aid if we were attacked.""Tensions have escalated in recent weeks after North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme.President Trump also said he was close to revealing his keenly awaited decision on the number of troops he plans to keep in Afghanistan. He said he had ""taken over a mess"", but was going to make it ""a lot less messy"".Speaking on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Mr Trump suggested his own statements on North Korea had not been tough enough, despite his threat this week to rain ""fire and fury"" upon the regime.North Korea has dismissed his dire warnings as ""nonsense"". Mr Trump railed against previous US administrations for being too weak on North Korea and also chided the North's closest ally, China, saying it could do ""a lot more"".He said: ""I will tell you this, if North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us they can be very, very nervous.""I'll tell you why… because things will happen to them like they never thought possible.""However, he added that the US would always consider negotiations.He added: ""I will tell you this, North Korea better get their act together or they're gonna be in trouble like few nations have ever been.""North Korea said on Wednesday it planned to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based.However, there has been no indication that any attack on the Pacific island is imminent.Yogita Limaye, BBC News, SeoulOn the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. ""I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,"" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual.Mr Trump meanwhile denied there were any mixed messages from his administration.Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson played down the rhetoric between the two sides. But in an interview with the BBC on Thursday, White House Deputy Assistant Sebastian Gorka dismissed the top diplomat's comments. ""You should listen to the president,"" he said. ""The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical.""Mr Gorka recalled a quote from a Holocaust survivor he often refers to when lecturing on grand strategy, saying: ""When a group of people repeatedly says they want to kill you, sooner or later you should take them seriously"". ""North Korea has said they wish to annihilate the United States and use nuclear weapons. Sooner or later, somebody should take them seriously,"" he said.

"President Donald Trump says his proposed border wall may not need to cover the whole US frontier with Mexico because of existing natural barriers.He told journalists travelling on Air Force One to France that it also needed to be transparent, to offer border guards visibility into Mexico.He also reiterated his desire the final design would involve solar panels.Building the wall, and having it paid for by Mexico, was one of Mr Trump's key campaign promises.Now, almost six months into his presidency, it seems he is acknowledging some of the geographical and practical difficulties of such a construction. On the flight to Paris from Washington, Mr Trump told reporters that a wall along the whole 2,000-mile (3,200km) US-Mexico border might not be necessary. ""You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious,"" he said. ""You have some areas that are so far away that you don't really have people crossing.""Instead, all that was required was ""anywhere from 700 to 900 miles of see-through wall"".There is already about 650 miles of see-through fencing along the border. It was built under President George W Bush and cost an estimated $7bn (£5.4bn).Mr Trump said it was vital the new construction was transparent to protect border guards from drug traffickers. ""As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don't see them,"" he said.""They hit you on the head with 27kg of stuff? It's over.""Drug traffickers have used catapults and other innovative methods to transfer their illegal cargo, says the BBC's Will Grant in Mexico.However, tunnels are far more common, and it is certainly not clear that any border guards have been injured in the way that Mr Trump described, our correspondent adds.Speaking to journalists, Mr Trump also confirmed he was still confident that the wall would involve vast solar panels. Last month he told supporters at a rally in Iowa that the panels would provide cheap energy and help to pay for the controversial wall.During his campaign, Mr Trump insisted he would make Mexico foot the bill, but President Enrique Peña Nieto has dismissed the idea.In his proposed budget unveiled in March, Mr Trump allocated $1.4bn for wall construction in the ongoing fiscal year, with another $2.6bn for the 2018 budget year starting on 1 October.However, Congress did not approve any funding for wall construction this year - only cash for repairs to the existing fencing.Mr Trump has now asked for $1.6bn towards the project, which is expected to cost up to $25bn.In April, US Homeland Security chief John Kelly said it was doubtful that a wall along the full border would ever be built.""It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,"" he said, adding that his department would look to build barriers in places that made sense."
"President Donald Trump has announced that the US is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement.He said moves to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers would begin.Mr Trump said during last year's presidential election campaign that he would take the step to help his country's oil and coal industries. Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge.The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below""  2C above pre-industrial levels  and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up to the deal.Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US.He claimed the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably.""In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States,"" he said.The speech contained several rhetorical flourishes reminiscent of his campaign speeches.""We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more - and they won't be,"" he said.""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or re-negotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under re-negotiation.""The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the move will be welcomed by many Trump supporters, as for them this is less about science - and more about sending a signal to so-called global elites. Analysts say the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement will make it more difficult for the world to reach the goals that it set for itself in the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Mr Trump did not give a timescale for US withdrawal, but White House sources had earlier suggested it could take up to four years.Former US President Barack Obama, who agreed to the Paris deal, immediately criticised the move, accusing the Trump administration of ""rejecting the future"".Republican congressional leaders and the US coal industry backed the move, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supporting Mr Trump ""for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs"". Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision ""one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st Century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing"".The leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement rejecting a renegotiation of the agreement.""We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,"" it said.Canada was ""deeply disappointed"" by President Trump's decision, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna told reporters. This was echoed by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who expressed her disappointment and told Mr Trump in a phone call that the deal protects the ""prosperity and security of future generations"".Leaders of the Nordic nations - Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland - also condemned the move.A United Nations spokeswoman said it was a ""major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security"".Small island nations whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels were critical of the move. The President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda Heine, said it was ""highly concerning for those of us that live on the frontline of climate change"".Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk confirmed that he was leaving his role as an adviser to the Trump administration in protest.""Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,"" he tweeted.By BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrathPresident Trump's statement is a very clear repudiation of the Paris agreement and international efforts to fund climate mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries. In many ways it is far worse than many had expected. He sees it as a clear job killer, as an economy strangler and a desperately unfair stitch-up by other countries wanting to take economic advantage of the US.He spoke of being open to re-negotiating the deal or trying to build a new agreement - but the idea of ""re-negotiation"" is an unlikely scenario. The scale of his opposition, seeing the deal as ""a massive redistribution of US wealth to other countries"" is a clear indication that he has fully bought into an economic nationalist and climate denier perspective. The question of unfairness cropped up again and again, how the world's worst polluters, China and India, had ""no meaningful obligations"" placed on them by the deal.  The overall tone and content of his speech clearly plays to his base but is also a clear disavowal of multilateralism, especially on climate change, and will definitely push other countries more closely together on this issue. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.

"US employment rose by more than expected last month, but wage growth remained subdued, latest figures show.The economy added 222,000 jobs in June, the US Department of Labor said, and job creation in April and May was higher than previously estimated.However, despite the job gains and a low 4.4% unemployment rate, wage growth remained tepid.Average wages rose 2.5% year-on-year, which analysts said was a sign the market still had room to improve.""Once again, the buzz kill on the jobs report is the lack of more substantial wage growth,"" said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. ""This suggests that we've not yet checked off the 'full employment' box, meaning more progress can be extracted from the job market."" Economists have expected job growth to slow and wages to rise, as more people are employed and firms have a harder time hiring.Job growth had appeared to decelerate in April and May, but in its latest release the Labor Department revised the job creation estimates to 207,000 in April from 174,000, and to 152,000 in May from 138,000.Employment growth has averaged 180,000 per month so far this year, in line with the average monthly gain of 187,000 in 2016. The job gains have encouraged more people to start looking for work, and this was behind a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 4.4% in June from 4.3% in May.""The unemployment rate rose slightly in June, but it was because of more people looking for work, a vote of confidence in the job market,"" wrote Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services, in a note.Some of the strongest employment growth in June came in the fields of health care and social assistance, financial activities and mining. Government employment also increased.But there are still more than five million Americans working part-time who would like to have full-time work, according to the Labor Department's report.Analysts said the job gains bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to continue to raise interest rates, even though inflation remains lower than policymakers at the US central bank would like. ""What matters to the Fed is that the rebound in payrolls strongly supports their view that the soft-looking spring data were 'transitory', and that the trend in the unemployment rate is guaranteed to fall further if payroll gains are sustained at anything like their June pace,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

"The US has told South Korea it wants to renegotiate a free trade agreement it struck in 2012, citing a lopsided trading relationship.It called South Korea a ""key trading partner"" but said it ""had real concerns about our significant trade imbalance"". The US trade deficit for goods and services with Korea was about $17bn last year, although it recorded a surplus in services.The move is the latest attempt by Donald Trump to alter trade terms.The US president wants to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement and has threatened tariffs on foreign products, such as steel.  He also withdrew from the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership agreement in January.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.The Obama administration had said the 2012 free trade agreement - described at the time as the most significant in 16 years - would boost US businesses. But exports of American goods to the country have declined almost 3% since the deal came into effect to $42.3bn. At the same time, imports from South Korea have increased by about 23%.""We can and must do better,"" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.In an interview in April, Mr Trump had called the agreement with South Korea a ""horrible deal"" and a ""one-way street.""The administration has called for a joint session on the subject to occur within 30 days."
"Up to 20 CIA informants were killed or imprisoned by the Chinese government between 2010 and 2012, the New York Times reports, damaging US information-gathering in the country for years.It is not clear whether the CIA was hacked or whether a mole helped the Chinese to identify the agents, officials told the paper.They said one of the informants was shot in the courtyard of a government building as a warning to others.The CIA did not comment on the report.Four former CIA officials spoke to the paper, telling it that information from sources deep inside the Chinese government bureaucracy started to dry up in 2010. Informants began to disappear in early 2011.The CIA and FBI teamed up to investigate the events in an operation one source said was codenamed Honey Badger.The paper said this investigation had centred on one former CIA operative but there was not enough evidence to arrest him. He now lives in another Asian country.In 2012, an official at China's security ministry was arrested on suspicion of spying for the US. He was said to have been lured into the CIA. No other such arrests appear to have reached public attention during that time.Matt Apuzzo, a New York Times journalist who worked on the story, told the BBC: ""One of the really troubling things about this is that we still don't know what happened. ""There's a divide within the American government over whether there was a mole inside the CIA or whether this was a tradecraft problem, that the CIA agents got sloppy and got discovered, or whether the Chinese managed to hack communications.""A few years later in 2015, the CIA pulled staff out of the US embassy in Beijing, after a hack blamed on the Chinese state exposed information about millions of US federal employees. If the events of 2010-2012 were helped by a similar hack, it was not one that was made public.The disappearance of so many spies damaged a network it had taken years to build up, the New York Times reports, and hampered operations for years afterwards,  even prompting questions from within the Obama administration as to why intelligence had slowed.Officials said it was one of the worst security breaches of recent years.By 2013, the Chinese government seemed to have lost its ability to identify US agents and the CIA moved back to trying to rebuild its network.Mr Apuzzo continued: ""For many years China and the US have been locked in this spy battle that's been going on behind the scenes. While doing this story we uncovered that Chinese intelligence have been able to infiltrate an NSA outpost in Taiwan. It goes back and forth.""The story was published during a temporary vacuum at the top of diplomatic relations between the two countries.The Trump administration has named Terry Branstad, who is the governor of Iowa, as its ambassador to China but he has not yet moved to Beijing.Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the US, has not commented, but in a recent press release, he mentioned ""the current positive momentum that the China-US relationship enjoys""."
"US Defence Secretary James Mattis has said the US is ""never out of diplomatic solutions"" in dealing with North Korea. It comes after President Donald Trump tweeted that ""talking is not the answer"" to the country's military ambitions.Russia has also warned the US against taking military action, saying it would be ""fraught with unpredictable consequences"".North Korea caused alarm by firing a missile over Japan on Tuesday.The missile, which Japan called an ""unprecedented"" threat, crossed the northern Hokkaido region early on Tuesday, triggering public alerts to take cover, before landing in the sea about 1,180km (730 miles) off the coast. North Korea later said it was ""the first step"" of wider military operations in the Pacific, and repeated its threats to the US Pacific island of Guam.Tensions have been particularly high in recent days, as the US and South Korea conducted annual joint military exercises which always anger Pyongyang. On Thursday, as the exercises came to an end, aircraft from the two nations - including two US nuclear-capable bombers and several fighter jets - carried out a live fire drill in South Korea in an apparent show of force. Just days ago, Mr Trump had said he believed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was ""starting to respect"" the US.But in a tweet late on Wednesday, he said: ""The US has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!""But when asked whether it was true that the US had lost hope in diplomacy, Mr Mattis openly disagreed with the president saying: ""No. We are never out of diplomatic solutions."" He was speaking as he met his South Korean counterpart, Song Young-moo, at the Pentagon. ""We continue to work together, and the minister and I share a responsibility to provide for the protection of our nations, our populations and our interests.""Russia, which shares a tiny border with North Korea and a maritime border with Japan, has said that US military activity in the region is partly to blame for the increase in tensions.In a phone call on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that diplomacy was the only way to overcome tensions on the Korean peninsula, which have been escalating in recent months.  A military solution would be ""fraught with unpredictable consequences,"" Reuters quoted Mr Lavrov as saying.He also said any further strengthening of sanctions against North Korea by the UN would be counter-productive.Meeting on Tuesday, the UN Security Council had unanimously condemned the launch and again demanded North Korea cease all missile testing. But it did not push for new sanctions.Speaking in Geneva at a UN Conference on Disarmament, North Korean diplomat Ju Yong-chol insisted the North would not be stifled and ""will not hesitate to take further tougher counter-measures."" He said Pyongyang strongly rejected the ""fabricated"" stories that it was to blame for the tensions of the Korean peninsula. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off?"
"US President Donald Trump has welcomed a Supreme Court ruling allowing his travel ban to be partly reinstated as a ""victory for our national security"".America's highest court also granted a White House request allowing part of its refugee ban to go into effect.The justices said they would consider in October whether the president's policy should be upheld or struck down.Mr Trump seeks to place a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on refugees.The president welcomed the ruling's qualified authorisation to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which he described as ""terror-prone countries"". ""As president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm,"" he added.  Mr Trump has already said the ban would take effect within 72 hours of court approval.The Supreme Court said in Monday's decision: ""In practical terms, this means that [the executive order] may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. ""All other foreign nationals are subject to the provisions of [the executive order].""The ruling also said it would permit a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the US to go into effect, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who do not have any ""bona fide relationship"" with an American individual or entity. Mark this down as a win for Donald Trump. The path to entry into the US for immigrants and refugees from the affected nations, if they don't have existing ties to the US - either through family, schools or employment - just became considerably harder.The decision marks a reaffirmation of the sweeping powers the president has traditionally been granted by the courts in areas of national security. There was fear in some quarters that the administration's ham-fisted implementation of its immigration policy could do lasting damage to the president's prerogatives. That appears not to be the case.The government, the justices write, has a ""compelling need to provide for the nation's security"". That includes being able to close the borders based on an evaluation of the potential of foreign threats - at least for now.The Supreme Court justices will fully consider the arguments on both sides next autumn. Of course, by that time it may not matter. The administration has three months to conduct its ""executive review"" of immigration policy and devise new guidelines.In the meantime, the gates to America just got a bit smaller.Big win for Trump and his travel banThe ruling clarifies that those who would be deemed to have such a relationship would include a foreign national who wishes to enter the US to live with or visit a family member, a student at an American university, an employee of a US company, or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.This would not apply, it said, to ""someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid [the executive order].""For example, a non-profit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.""Yes. Three of the court's conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - wrote that they would have allowed the travel ban to go into full effect.Justice Thomas said the government's interest in preserving national security outweighs any hardship to people denied entry into the country.Mr Trump restored a 5-4 conservative majority to the Supreme Court when his nominee, Justice Gorsuch, joined its bench in April. There are five Republican appointees on the court and four Democratic appointees.The US president insisted his ban was necessary for national security amid a slew of terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin and other cities. However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and the lower courts broadly seemed to agree.The president's policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland days following its issuance on 6 March.The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said in May the ban was ""rooted in religious animus"" toward Muslims.The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in June: ""National security is not a 'talismanic incantation' that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.""The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports. It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria.The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems.But Mr Trump was unhappy about having to do so, calling it a ""watered down, politically correct"" version of the first one."
"The UK government and police have reacted with anger after a US newspaper published photos apparently showing the scene of the Manchester bomb attack.Counter terror police chiefs said the leak undermined their investigation and victims' and witnesses' confidence.A Whitehall source added: ""We are furious. This is completely unacceptable.""Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he had raised the leaks with the US ambassador.Earlier UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was irritated with the US for releasing information about bomber Salman Abedi.Ms Rudd said she had told Washington ""it should not happen again"".But the New York Times then published photos it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a ""possible detonator"".The paper said the alleged evidence suggested ""a powerful, high-velocity charge, and a bomb in which its shrapnel was carefully and evenly packed"".The photos were subsequently published in the UK media.""These images leaked from inside the US system will be distressing for victims, their families and the wider public,"" the Whitehall source added.""The issue is being raised at every relevant level by the British authorities with their US counterparts.""The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council said it valued its relationships with ""trusted intelligence, law enforcement and security partners around the world"", saying this allowed ""privileged and sensitive information"" to be shared in the fight against terrorism.But it added: ""When that trust is breached it undermines these relationships, and undermines our investigations and the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families.""This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorised disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counter terrorism investigation.""Mr Burnham told Newsnight a decision had been taken to adopt a ""cautious approach"" to making information public, ""and yet the first reports were coming seemingly out of the United States"".""But it worries me greatly and in fact I made known my concerns about it to the US ambassador,"" he said, adding: ""The British police and security services need to be in the lead when this is a live investigation here.""Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chaired the influential Commons Home Affairs Committee before the general election campaign started, tweeted: ""V troubled by US leaking intelligence UK has given them in middle of live investigation where public safety at risk. What is going on?""Monday night's attack at Manchester Arena killed 22 people - including children - and injured 64.Information about the bomber's identity first emerged in the US - with American TV networks CBS and NBC naming Abedi as the suspect.On Wednesday morning Ms Rudd was asked whether she would be looking at how information sharing may have resulted in the premature release of details the British police and security services had not wanted in the public domain.""Yes, quite frankly,"" the home secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""The British police have been very clear they want to control the flow of information in order to protect operational integrity - the element of surprise - so it is irritating if it gets released from other sources, and I've been very clear with our friends that that should not happen again.""Pressed on whether the Americans had compromised the investigation, she said: ""I wouldn't go that far, but I can say they are perfectly clear about the situation and that it shouldn't happen again.""Seven people have been arrested in the UK since Monday night, including Abedi's older brother Ismail, 23.Younger brother Hashem, 20, was held by militia in the Libyan capital Tripoli, as was their father.Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I think it's very clear that this is a network that we are investigating.""And as I've said, it continues at a pace. There's extensive investigations going on and activity taking place across Greater Manchester, as we speak.""As part of their investigation, police raided a block of flats near Manchester Piccadilly station in the city centre, requiring them to carry out a controlled explosion and briefly close the railway line.Police carried out another controlled explosion in the early hours of Thursday morning at an address in the Moss Side area of Manchester.Anyone with information about the attack can call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789321.The victims include 14-year-old Sorrell Leczkowski, from Leeds, whose grandmother is critically injured in hospital.Others who died are mother-of-three Michelle Kiss, Nell Jones, 14, eight-year-old Saffie Roussos, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Jane Tweddle-Taylor, 51, Martyn Hett, 29, and Olivia Campbell, 15.Kelly Brewster, 32, John Atkinson, 28, Georgina Callander - thought to be 18 - and Marcin and Angelika Klis, a Polish couple from York, have also been named.South Shields couple Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19 have been named among the dead. Family members paid tribute to the teenagers and in a statement issued by police said: ""They wanted to be together forever and now they are"".Some of the victims had been making their way outside at the end of the gig when Abedi detonated his ""nuts-and-bolts"" bomb. Others had been waiting in the foyer to pick up children and family.A serving Cheshire police officer - off-duty at the time - was also among those killed. She has not yet been named.The BBC understands her partner is critically ill and his two children were injured.Of the 64 injured, 20 are in a critical condition. Twelve of them are children.Mr Hopkins said the families of all those injured had been contacted.Salman Abedi is understood to have been a 22-year-old born in Manchester to Libyan parents, and a former University of Salford student.He attended Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009 and 2011, and The Manchester College until 2013. Hamid El-Said, who worked for the UN on tackling radicalisation and now works at Manchester Metropolitan University, said Abedi had had a ""really bad relationship"" with his family and his parents had tried but failed to keep him on the ""right path"".""Eventually he was doing very bad at his university, at his education, and he didn't complete, and they tried to take him back to Libya several times. He had difficulties adjusting to European lifestyle,"" he said.A former classmate of Abedi's told the BBC that he was a ""very jokey lad"" but also ""very short tempered"" and would get angry at ""the littlest thing"".The man, who did not want to be identified, said Abedi had hung around ""the wrong crowd and was very, very gullible"".Before leaving Burnage Academy in 2011, Abedi had become ""more and more religious"", the man added.A Muslim community worker, who did not want to be identified, has told the BBC that two people who had known Abedi at college had made separate calls to a hotline to warn the police about his extremist views.He said they had been worried that Abedi was ""supporting terrorism"" and he had expressed the view that ""being a suicide bomber was ok"". The calls are thought to have been made five years ago, he added."
"Amid relentless scrutiny over possible ties between his presidential campaign and Russia, an extraordinary suggestion has emerged - that Donald Trump could pardon himself or his family.The Washington Post reported that Mr Trump inquired about the scope of his power to issue pardons, as a means of undercutting special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the US election.Mr Trump has since tweeted that ""all agree the US President has the complete power to pardon"".To some experts, this would be like a judge presiding over their own trial. Others though say Mr Trump may be correct - although that is not to say it would be a good idea.The right of US presidents to issue pardons is enshrined in the constitution. Under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, presidents have ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment"". In practice a president could offer clemency or a commutation, i.e. reducing a prison sentence. A president can also offer a full pardon, in essence an official statement of forgiveness for a crime.An individual does not have to be charged or convicted to receive a pardon, and a president cannot pardon people over state-level crimes.In the context of the Russia investigation, Mr Trump could grant immunity to aides or family members, limiting Mr Mueller's scope.The short answer is we do not know, given the short wording but broad application of the constitution, and the fact there is no precedent for a US leader issuing such a pardon.Some legal experts say no, citing an opinion issued by the Justice Department days before Richard Nixon's resignation that he could not pardon himself ""under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case"".""The Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law,"" wrote Laurence H. Tribe, Richard Painter and Norman Eisen in the Washington Post.Others though say the constitution does not preclude a self-pardon.""A self-pardon might well be outrageously improper... but the response the Constitution creates for such misconduct is impeachment, a political rather than criminal remedy,"" Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard University told Vox. While there are differing opinions among experts about whether Mr Trump could pardon himself, there is more consensus that such a move would be fraught with difficulties.Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, said a president pardoning himself would raise serious questions ""of an abuse of power"".""It is also important to keep in mind that such a pardon would not protect against either an impeachment or state charges,"" he told the LA Times. ""It would also not stop the investigation.""Impeachment is primarily a political process, so pardoning could not prevent a hostile Congress advancing proceedings against a president. Two University of Chicago law professors, Daniel Hemel and Eric Posner, writing in the New York Times, argue that if Mr Trump pardoned relatives he could open himself to the risk of being charged with obstruction of justice.If he were to pardon himself, questions would follow about whether it is valid, and it could ultimately end up in the Supreme Court.How easy is it for Donald Trump to be impeached?Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal.He argued it was essential for the nation to move on. It is a decision still debated today - some say it cost him the 1976 election, others that he made the difficult, but right, choice.Presidents have made sweeping pardons to heal national wounds, such as when President Andrew Johnson pardoned Southerners after the Civil War.Bill Clinton caused uproar when he pardoned scores of people on his last day in office, including a brother-in-law and Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been indicted for tax evasion and fraud.Perhaps the most famous beneficiary of President Obama's clemency was Chelsea Manning, the US Army Private sentenced to 35 years in jail for leaking documents to Wikileaks.

"A top diplomat at the US embassy in Beijing has stepped down, apparently because he disagreed with President Donald Trump's climate change policy.The state department said Deputy Chief of Mission David Rank had resigned.US media outlets say he stepped down over Mr Trump's controversial announcement last week that the US was withdrawing from the Paris agreement.The US embassy in Beijing told the BBC it was Mr Rank's personal decision and his years of service were appreciated. Before becoming president, Mr Trump had said climate change was a hoax created by China to undermine US manufacturing.He has said withdrawing the US from the 2015 Paris agreement - under which 188 countries committed to limiting rises in global temperatures - would protect the US economy.But his decision to do so last week was met with much criticism worldwide.The New York Times quoted unnamed friends of Mr Rank as saying he was deeply frustrated about the US policy toward China, particularly regarding climate change.The embassy in Beijing did not comment on reports that he had told embassy staff he could not defend the decision and did not want to present formal notification to Chinese authorities.Mr Rank joined the state department in 1990 and had previously served in Afghanistan, Taiwan, Greece and Mauritius, according to his profile page which was still on the Beijing embassy's website as of Tuesday.Appointed in January 2016, he was effectively the top US diplomat in China as he was also the acting ambassador. Terry Branstad, who was selected by Mr Trump for the post, fills that position later this month.The state department said the embassy's economics councillor Jonathan Fritz would be filling in behind Mr Rank immediately."
"The US economy slowed dramatically in the first three months of the year, according to official data.GDP expanded at an annual rate of 0.7% in the first quarter - the slowest rate since the first quarter of 2014.It will be unwelcome news for President Donald Trump who, during his election campaign, made a pledge to raise growth to 4%.In a bid to fulfil that promise, on Wednesday the White House proposed slashing the rate of corporation tax.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin unveiled President Trump's tax blueprint, which aims to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15%.The plan also proposed an incentive for companies to bring back money held overseas and a cut in tax rate for individuals, although the plans were light on detail.What will Trump's tax plan actually do?Trump seeks tax windfall for businessThe Trump administration may be reassured by the trend in recent years for growth figures to be depressed in the first quarter, but then pick up later in the year.""US GDP figures are typically weaker in the first quarter, so this reading is in line with the seasonal trend,"" said Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management.""We haven't yet had the expected fiscal stimulus from Trump, the effects of which may not be seen until the end of this year or the start of 2018.""The annualised first quarter growth rate of 0.7% was less than the 1% analysts had been expecting, and a slowdown from the 2.1% growth rate seen in the final quarter of last yearThe slowdown was down to stagnant consumer spending, economists said.""Household spending was held down by a drop back in motor vehicle sales from a near-record high at the end of last year and the unseasonably warm winter weather, which depressed utilities spending,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.But he thinks consumer spending will ""rebound"" as personal income showed healthy growth and data suggests that consumer confidence remains high.Close Brothers' Ms Curtin also pointed out that other data suggested strength in the US economy .""While investors might be disappointed with the reading, it has been a steady start to the year with inflation looking benign, a resilient jobs market and positive PMI [purchasing managers'] data.""Just two days ago, as they released President Trump's proposals for large tax cuts, his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and his National Economic Director, Gary Cohn, were boasting that an annual GDP growth rate of 3% and above was possible. Indeed their tax plan relies on higher growth to make up for the lost revenue of lower tax rates. And the president himself likes to talk about 4% growth! Today's data shows how bold those claims are. The fact is the US economy has been in steady-but-slow growth mode for years. While it's true that the first three months of a year are usually particularly weak, and that growth will likely pick up in the coming months, it's also the case that a 3% annual growth rate hasn't been consistently delivered since the 1990s. So whatever it is that would boost growth - be it tax cuts or large government spending - is likely to require far-reaching legislation from Congress. Based on the first 100 days, there are few signs that the Trump administration can secure that."
"President Donald Trump has warned North Korea to expect ""big, big trouble"" if anything happens to the US territory of Guam. Speaking at his Bedminister, New Jersey golf resort, he promised the territory would be ""very safe, believe me"".Mr Trump said the US could impose further sanctions, ""as strong as they get"", on North Korea.He later spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who stressed the need for a peaceful resolution, Chinese TV said.President Xi called on ""relevant parties"" to exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would exacerbate tension, state TV reported, adding that it was in the interests of both China and the US to pursue the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.The White House said both sides agreed North Korea must stop its ""provocative and escalatory behaviour"".""Hopefully, it will all work out,"" Mr Trump said earlier, striking an upbeat tone after a day of rhetorical brinkmanship.""Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you.""Earlier on Friday, the president said the US military was ""locked and loaded"" to deal with North Korea, should the need arise.""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong-un will find another path!"" he tweeted.He spoke as Pyongyang accused him of ""driving"" the Korean peninsula to the ""brink of a nuclear war"".North Korea has announced plans to fire missiles near the US territory of Guam.Moscow said the exchange of threats between Washington and Pyongyang ""worry us very much"".Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rated the risk of military conflict as ""very high"" as he put forward a joint Russian-Chinese plan to defuse the crisis.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no military solution, and ""an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer.""Asked about his ""locked and loaded"" tweet on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I hope that they [North Korea] are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said, and what I said is what I mean… those words are very, very easy to understand.""He added: ""If he [Kim Jong-un] utters one threat in the form of an overt threat... with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast.""Earlier in the week, Mr Trump threatened to rain ""fire and fury"" on Pyongyang.On Friday, North Korea's official KCNA news agency accused Washington of a ""criminal attempt to impose nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation"".Pyongyang's media outlet said America was making ""desperate efforts"" to test weapons in the Korean peninsula.The US is ""the mastermind of nuclear threat, the heinous nuclear war fanatic"", the report said.Tensions have risen since North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.The regime was further angered by last week's UN decision to increase economic sanctions against it.North Korea said it was finalising a plan to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based, along with more than 160,000 US citizens.There has been no indication that any actual attack on the Pacific island is imminent.On Thursday Mr Trump suggested that his own statements on North Korea had not been tough enough, warning the regime to be ""very, very nervous"".However, he added that the US would always consider negotiations. He also chided the North's closest ally, China, saying it could do ""a lot more"".China's state-run Global Times newspaper wrote that Beijing should stay neutral if North Korea launches an attack that threatens the US.But it also said that if the US and South Korea attacked North Korea to force regime change, then China must intervene to prevent it.

"The US says it is withdrawing funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), an agency that promotes family planning in more than 150 countries.The state department says the agency supports or participates in a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China.But the UNFPA says this is an ""erroneous claim"", and that its work does not break any US laws.In total $32.5m (£26m) in funds will be withdrawn for the 2017 financial year.This is the first of the promised cuts to US financial contributions to the UN by the Trump administration.Saving Mosul's mothers-to-beThe UNFPA, like other UN agencies, is funded by governments voluntarily.In 2015, it received $979m in donations, with the US being its fourth-largest donor.Earlier this year, President Donald Trump reinstated a ban on US funding of any international organisation that provided any kind of abortion service or advice.The state department referred to the presidential directive from January and a provision called the Kemp-Kasten Amendment in its statement on Monday.""This determination was made based on the fact that China's family planning policies still involve the use of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation, and UNFPA partners on family planning activities with the Chinese government agency responsible for these coercive policies,"" the state department said.The UNFPA calls those claims ""erroneous"" and says that ""all of its work promotes the rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination"".It says its programmes have saved the lives of tens of thousands of women. Its works include:The UN Population Fund has often been the target of conservative Republican administrations, the BBC's Nada Tawfik in New York reports. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and George W Bush withheld funding for the same reason.The money that had been allocated to the UNFPA for the fiscal year 2017 will be ""transferred and reprogrammed to the Global Health Programs account,"" the state department said.The account will be used by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to support family planning, maternal and reproductive health activities in developing countries, it added."
"In the space of one afternoon this week, Rex Tillerson encapsulated the administration's policy shift in the Persian Gulf. At noon on Wednesday, he was championing economic ties between the US and Saudi Arabia at a joint ""CEO summit"" organised by the US Chamber of Commerce, promising full consular support to facilitate trade and investment. A few hours later he was comparing Iran to North Korea and excoriating it for ""alarming and ongoing provocations"" that undermine US interests in countries such as Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.The decision to adopt a more aggressive approach towards Iran and a stronger tilt towards Saudi Arabia has been taking shape since Tehran was first put ""on notice"" in February by then National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The Saudis have been effusive about this ""turning point,"" welcoming the reset in a relationship strained by Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with their Shia rival, and his criticism of their messy involvement in Yemen's civil war.The secretary of defence and Iran hawk James Mattis fleshed it out further during a trip to Riyadh, also on Wednesday, as it happens. He stressed the importance of ""reinforcing Saudi Arabia's resistance to Iran's mischief,"" seeing, like his Saudi hosts, a malign Iranian hand ""everywhere…there is trouble in the region.""  What does this mean? First, that the future of the deal restricting Iran's nuclear programme is in doubt. Although, as I wrote earlier this week it is more likely to fail by way of the administration piling pressure on Tehran than formally withdrawing from the agreement. Secondly, the possibility of greater US involvement in Yemen's civil war, which the UN says has killed 10,000 civilians and brought 17 million to the verge of starvation.Currently the US provides indirect assistance to a coalition made up principally of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels. And that was significantly scaled back by the Obama administration because of the number of civilians killed by indiscriminate Saudi air strikes. 100 days of Trump - the full storySeven ways the world has changed under TrumpThe Trump White House is looking to resume missile sales frozen by Obama.And it's considering intelligence and planning support for an Emirati-led offensive to retake the Houthi-held port of Hodeida, a vital avenue for humanitarian aid, but also for rebel supplies. A US official travelling with General Mattis told the Voice of America that the Trump administration doesn't believe the Houthis will return to the negotiating table without more military pressure.This is also the Saudi position. In fact, Trump's team has adopted the Saudi and Emirati narrative about the conflict to a much greater degree than the Obama administration, which is that Iran has been actively supporting and directing the Houthi uprising as a means of gaining leverage over the Sunni Arab states in the region.For nearly 60 years the US has sought to keep any one power, other than itself, from becoming dominant in the strategically important oil rich Gulf.And since the Iranian revolution in 1979 it has forged a de-facto military alliance with the Sunni monarchies to deter Tehran.Obama tinkered with that balance, hoping the nuclear deal would empower moderates in Iran who could normalise relations with their regional rivals. The Trump administration has not only rejected that as a failed approach, it has signalled its willingness to confront, rather than contain, the Islamic Republic.
