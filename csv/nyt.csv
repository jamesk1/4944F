"WASHINGTON — A recent major exercise by the Russian military revealed significant strides in its ability to conduct the sort of complex, large-scale operations, using drones and other new technology, that would be part of any all-out war with the United States in Europe, according to American and allied officials.Preliminary Pentagon and NATO assessments of the exercise, one of the largest of its kind since the end of the Cold War, are classified and will take months to complete. But Western officials said the military maneuvers, known as Zapad, Russian for “west,” far exceeded in scope and scale what Moscow had said it would conduct, and tracked more closely to what American intelligence officials suspected would unfold, based on Russian troop buildups in August.Before the exercise, Russia said the drills would involve fewer than 13,000 troops engaged in a counterterrorism scenario in Belarus, the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, the Baltic Sea region and around St. Petersburg. Instead, tens of thousands of Russian troops in the Arctic and Far East, the Black Sea, close to Ukraine’s borders and in the Abkhazia region of Georgia also joined in, Western military officials said.“In effect, these activities together constituted a single strategic exercise, involving the full spectrum of Russian and Belarusian military,” said Oana Lungescu, the NATO spokeswoman. That array included warships, submarines, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks and artillery, air defenses, anti-ship missiles, special forces, and short-range and nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles.The military exercise, planned for many months, was part of a larger effort by President Vladimir V. Putin to showcase Russia’s military prowess as it tries to reassert itself as a world power. Beyond Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election in support of the Trump campaign, its military has in recent years dispatched troops to Syria, captured Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine, rattled the Baltic States with snap exercises and buzzed NATO planes and ships.Allied military and independent analysts said that over the course of the nearly weeklong Zapad exercise, held from Sept. 14 to 20, Russian armed forces assimilated new technology and integrated information better than in the past to improve the military’s lethality. And the Russian Army demonstrated improved logistics to support war fighters, as well as new technology to conceal and protect those vital supply lines, analysts said.From the foxhole to brigade command posts, Russian soldiers are now using increasingly sophisticated electronic communications gear, and Russian drones have proliferated to the point that they are now a part of almost every exercise.“These are key things to practice for the initial period of war, where time and distance are crucial, and whoever gets there first has a big advantage,” said Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist at the Center for Naval Analyses’ Russia program who chronicled the exercise on his blog. “The exercise did a good job showing how Russia continues to improve combined arms operations, coordinating between different services.”In a Senate hearing last week, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to offer a detailed assessment in the unclassified setting, but told senators, “We watched very carefully what the Russians have done during the Operation Zapad to make sure that we understand where they are in terms of capability development and what the implications are for NATO security and for U.S. security.”Gen. Lori J. Robinson, head of the Pentagon’s Northern Command, which is charged with defending American territory, said at a conference in Washington last week that one emerging conclusion involved Russia’s “ability to hold targets at risk at ranges that we’re not used to,” apparently referring to Moscow’s arsenal of medium- and long-range missiles. She did not elaborate, adding only that her command would conduct a “deep-dive” review of the exercise this week.Part of the exercise took place at the Luzhsky Training Range, a large open space cut from an undulating wooded area, mostly pines, about 100 miles southwest of St. Petersburg. On a rainy Monday afternoon, Mr. Putin arrived by helicopter, and from an enclosed viewing stand watched the proceedings through binoculars.The enemy of the day was a mock foe attacking Russian territory. Ground forces advanced from the left and right. Spectators could hear aircraft overhead, but low clouds obscured them. A seemingly unending stream of bullets, shells and rockets was launched. Large bombs plummeted into the range, sending huge clouds of smoke into the sky, along with giant clods of earth and shock waves toward the spectators.In the distance, cutouts of the enemy soldiers could be seen. But few Russian soldiers were on view. It was very much a display of hardware and high-powered weaponry — tanks driving at high speed, Mi-28 and Ka-52 helicopters swooping in to the attack from both sides, modern rockets as well as the older but terrifying swoosh-sounding Grad launchers. A commentary was broadcast over a loudspeaker system.Mr. Putin sat alongside Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, and Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff. Foreign military observers watched from small covered stands. After the 45-minute exercise, Mr. Putin stayed for another 45 minutes to confer with his commanders, and then flew off.Not everything went as planned during the exercise. At least one bystander narrowly escaped death when a Russian military helicopter accidentally fired rockets into a parking lot next to a firing range near St. Petersburg.While Western military officials emphasized that the United States and Russia are not on the brink of war, they expressed concern that the heightened Russian military activity could lead to unintended confrontations.The Defense Intelligence Agency summed up the exercise this way in an email to The New York Times: “Russia’s forces are becoming more mobile, more balanced and capable of conducting the full range of modern warfare.”Going into the exercise, American and Baltic military officers had expressed fear that the maneuvers could be used as a pretext to increase Russia’s military presence in Belarus, a central European nation that borders three critical NATO allies: Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ordered that a wider array of European partners have access to classified American information during the exercise to simulate conditions during combat. “Zapad forced us to get smarter about how to share intelligence,” said Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the top United States Army commander in Europe.Officials said it was still too soon to determine whether Russia would use the exercises to permanently station more troops and matériel in Belarus. Some American analysts said Mr. Putin would not necessarily need to do so, given that he had successfully carried out an exercise in intimidation that drew worldwide news coverage and recalled the most ominous days of the Cold War.Linas Antanas Linkevicius, Lithuania’s foreign minister, said Belarusian officials had told Lithuania that Russia had not expected to fully withdraw its equipment until Sept. 30, after which NATO allies would be able to see what got left behind, he said. A Belarusian military newspaper reported that the last of the Russian troops had left on Friday.For Lithuania, the exercise helped draw the world’s attention to Russia’s increasingly belligerent actions toward its neighbors, “and that served a very positive purpose, in my view,” Mr. Linkevicius said in an interview.“Everyone was talking about it,” he said. “That’s why it didn’t turn into something other than an exercise.”For Western analysts, the Russian military display might have served an additional purpose: tipping off what Moscow fears most about the United States and its NATO allies. “A lot of attention was paid to fending off a U.S. aerospace operation, shooting down cruise missiles, getting ships out to sea while under incoming missile fire and concealment of moving forces to avoid getting hit,” Mr. Kofman said. “The fear of Western technological superiority and dominance in the air domain was quite palpable.”"
"WASHINGTON — Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, was at a loss on Tuesday. After the massacre of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, he challenged the pro-gun bent of his state and co-authored legislation to expand background checks of gun purchasers, only to see the measure fail.“I just think that common sense has to prevail,” a dispirited Mr. Manchin said, explaining why he thinks that now is “the wrong time” to revive his bill. “But until that happens, until other people feel the same, we’re at a stalemate and that’s a shame.”For years, amid a string of mass shootings in places whose names are by now seared into the national psyche — Columbine, Aurora, Virginia Tech, Newtown, San Bernardino, Orlando and now Las Vegas — Democrats have tried to enact what they call “common-sense” gun restrictions. Time and time again, they have failed.This week’s massacre in Las Vegas, which killed at least 59 people and injured more than 500, appears to have done little to change Washington’s gun control dynamic.As they have done in the past, Democrats are contemplating legislation shaped to the massacre; Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested targeting kits that could legally transform semiautomatic weapons to automatic ones. The Las Vegas gunman apparently used so-called bump stocks — legal modifications to semiautomatic rifles — to help them fire more like automatic weapons.“This is the least we should do in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history,” Ms. Feinstein said. “It should be our highest priority.”That tactic mirrored the Democrats’ tailored approaches of the past: After the Newtown shooting, they called for background checks for all gun purchases, including those at gun shows and from online sellers. After the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., last year, they tried to ban gun sales to people on federal no-fly or terrorism watch lists. After the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, it was improving background checks to catch mental illness.And as they have done in the past, Republicans tried to steered the conversation in another direction, this time spotlighting the work of emergency medical workers. President Trump praised the swiftness of the Las Vegas law enforcement response, calling it “in many ways, a miracle.”In the Capitol, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, rebuffed questions about potential legislative action during his regular news conference Tuesday afternoon, saying that he thought it “particularly inappropriate” to politicize the massacre so soon. Republicans, he said, would instead remain focused on advancing a tax overhaul.“Look, the investigation’s not even been completed,” Mr. McConnell said. “And I think’s it’s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any.”Indeed, the only gun legislation on the Republicans’ agenda appears to be the so-called Hearing Protection Act — a gun rights measure that would eliminate a $200 tax on firearm silencers, refund silencer-tax payments back to October of 2015, and ease registration requirements.That measure has been working its way through the House, though Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Tuesday that he has no plans at the moment to bring it up for a vote. House Democratic leaders have called for Mr. Ryan to withdraw the gun silencers bill, and to create a special committee to investigate gun violence in America, which would report back with legislative solutions.“We are stuck,” said Representative Linda T. Sánchez of California, the vice chairwoman of the House Democratic caucus. “We have asked time and time again of our Republican counterparts to please engage in this discussion of how do we stop gun violence, and they are completely unwilling to do anything to help us out on that issue.”Congress is, in fact, not completely stuck — even on difficult issues framed in terms of life and death. House Republicans on Tuesday took up legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The House just passed legislation 237-189.The contrasting action and inaction — on abortion and gun control — spotlighted the stark politics of “life” in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting. As they debated the abortion bill, members of both parties juxtaposed the two issues.Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who was at a congressional baseball practice in June when a gunman opened fire, nearly killing a senior Republican, said that the gun issue was “separate” from the abortion debate.But Republicans who praised emergency medical workers in Las Vegas also repurposed that praise in the abortion debate. “These are little boys and little girls waiting to be born,” said Representative Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, in a speech in the House defending the abortion ban. “If we do not stand for them, who will stand for them? If we are not the first responders, who will be the first responders?”Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, was incredulous.“There is this absolute silence on the deaths that have been created through guns and irresponsible gun ownership and yet here we are somehow talking about the sanctity of life when it relates to abortions,” she said.Representative Louise Slaughter, a Democrat of New York, put in bluntly. “I don’t know anything else to call it but pure hypocrisy,” she said. “We love it until it’s born and then it’s somebody else’s problem.”So far, Republicans in the House have shown no interest in any additional legislation that would limit guns. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third-ranking House Republican nearly killed by a gunman in June, reappeared Tuesday at a House Republican leadership news conference. He said nothing about gun legislation.In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Scalise said that what he saw in Las Vegas “fortified” his stance in support of the Second Amendment.Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, did tell an NBC News reporter that lawmakers “ought to take a look at” conversion kits that can make guns more lethal. But Mr. Thune also suggested little could be achieved through legislation.“I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions,” he said. “To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said — get small.”Some gun safety advocates acknowledged that expanding background checks would not have prevented the massacre in Las Vegas. Among them was Lori Hankey Haas, whose daughter was wounded in the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007.“Is there a single policy that would have prevented this particular mass shooting?” asked Ms. Haas, who is now the Virginia state director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, an advocacy group. “I doubt it seriously. But it doesn’t mean you don’t try.”"
"WASHINGTON — In the absence of any hint of a motive in the Las Vegas massacre, President Trump late Monday morning called it “pure evil.” Notably, he avoided the word “terrorism.”The gunman, Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old  with no significant criminal history and no obvious ideological motive, remained a blank space, offering little for Americans who crave an explanation for the tragedy to seize upon.But that did not deter a daylong jumble of industrious, contradictory and often self-interested speculation.Early in the day, right-wing websites named the wrong man as the gunman, labeling him “another angry far-left shooter,” in the words of the Gateway Pundit. A conservative Las Vegas radio personality, Wayne Allyn Root, told his 110,000 Twitter followers: “This is real thing. Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack” — an early guess given a brief boost by a claim of responsibility from the Islamic State.Then the F.B.I. knocked down the Islamic State angle, noting that the group has a history of false claims. The guessing game resumed: Was it a plot by “deep-state Democrats” (Alex Jones of the conspiracy site Infowars) or perhaps divine punishment for the “profound disrespect” shown to Mr. Trump and the national anthem (the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson)? Was it something to do with country music, given the concert crowd Mr. Paddock targeted? Could it be linked in any way to the long-ago history of Mr. Paddock’s father as a bank robber on the F.B.I.’s most-wanted list?“Stephen Paddock motive” ranked high among Google searches, and it remained uncertain whether more evidence would fill the void about what drove his killing rampage or the slaughter would drift into history as one more act of American mass violence to elude easy categorizing.Mass killing of innocents, even on the scale of Las Vegas, does not automatically meet the generally accepted definition of terrorism, which requires a political, ideological or religious motive. But beyond that academic analysis, in political debate in a polarized country, the word “terrorism” is also a verbal weapon, freely wielded — especially when the accused is Muslim.“The label is so powerfully pejorative and carries so much weight,” said Martha Crenshaw, a terrorism expert at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation.The first reports of any mass attack summon not only a general sense of grief, but anxieties and wishes in specific American subgroups: Muslim Americans pray that the attacker does not share their faith, for instance; conservatives and liberals alike want the assailant to turn out to be a member of their political opposition.“In today’s political climate, it’s so polarized that people are hoping it’s not pinned on their side,” Ms. Crenshaw said. As a political progressive, she admitted to a passing feeling of dread on Monday that the gunman might come from the left.More cynical observers of American politics may feel that Mr. Paddock’s advanced age, white race and non-Muslim religious background make it less likely that he will be tagged a terrorist, whatever may emerge about his politics.And this gruesome tragedy, perhaps the deadliest single shooting episode in American history, quickly and predictably reopened a debate on gun control. If Mr. Paddock’s purpose was uncertain, his choice of weapons was unmistakable.The tussle over what terrorism is dates back to the beginning of its modern history, said David C. Rapoport, the dean of American historians of terror. He said a Russian radical who shot the governor of St. Petersburg in 1878, Vera Zasulich, was asked at trial why she laid down her gun after merely wounding her target.“I’m not a criminal — I’m a terrorist,” she declared, he said, suggesting that she had made her political point and felt no need to pile on with lethal violence.“That’s not our conception of terrorism,” said Mr. Rapoport, a retired professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and founding editor of the journal Terrorism and Political Violence.Mr. Rapoport’s well-known taxonomy identifies four major waves of terrorism since the 1880s: the anarchists; anticolonial activists; leftists around the time of the Vietnam War; and since 1979, religious zealots, including non-Muslims. He said each of the earlier waves lasted about 40 years, and that he expected the period of religious terrorism to fade by 2025.But in every case, the perpetrators had a clear ideological agenda. They were also overwhelmingly young, Mr. Rapoport said. Mr. Paddock so far seems to fit none of the patterns. His age, a year short of qualifying for Medicare, is especially perplexing.Still, the phenomenon of mass shooting, whether or not it properly carries the terrorist label in a particular case, is a recognizable American phenomenon. And from the point of view of potential victims, the crucial factor may not be a specific ideological motivation but the decision to target random, innocent people.Homicides in the United States rose more than 8 percent in 2016, to 17,250, the F.B.I. reported last month. But most killings by far have a clear answer to the question of why. Many are crimes of passion; many others accompany robberies, sexual assaults or disputes inside the drug trade or other criminal enterprises.Shooting down systematically from a hotel window on a crowd of 22,000 people enjoying a concert is a different matter, said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State who studies terrorism. Even if that name does not apply, Mr. Paddock’s baffling attack unquestionably spread terror far beyond Las Vegas.“The question people ask about this kind of violence is, Can I imagine myself in the situation of the victims?” Mr. Mueller said. “In this case, the answer is absolutely yes.”"
"WASHINGTON — Justice Anthony M. Kennedy has long been troubled by extreme partisan gerrymandering, where the party in power draws voting districts to give itself a lopsided advantage in elections. But he has never found a satisfactory way to determine when voting maps are so warped by politics that they cross a constitutional line.After spirited Supreme Court arguments on Tuesday, there was reason to think Justice Kennedy may be ready to join the court’s more liberal members in a groundbreaking decision that could reshape American democracy by letting courts determine when lawmakers have gone too far.Justice Kennedy asked skeptical questions of lawyers defending a Wisconsin legislative map that gave Republicans many more seats in the State Assembly than their statewide vote tallies would have predicted. He asked no questions of the lawyer representing the Democratic voters challenging the map.There was something like consensus among the justices that voting maps drawn by politicians to give advantage to their parties are an unattractive feature of American democracy. But the justices appeared split about whether the court could find a standard for determining when the practice was unconstitutional.“Gerrymandering is distasteful,” said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., “but if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something that’s manageable.”Some of the court’s more liberal members said the problem represented a crisis for democracy and that the Supreme Court should step in.“What’s really behind all of this?” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked. She answered her own question: “The precious right to vote.”In extended remarks, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. expressed worry that the court’s authority and legitimacy would be hurt were it to start striking down voting districts in favor of one political party or another.“That is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country,” he said.Paul M. Smith, a lawyer for the Democratic voters, urged the court to act. “You are the only institution in the United States that can solve this problem just as democracy is about to get worse because of the way gerrymandering is getting so much worse,” he told the justices.Without the Supreme Court’s intervention, Mr. Smith said, other states will follow Wisconsin’s lead. The round of redistricting that will follow the 2020 census, he said, “will produce a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen.”The Supreme Court has never struck down an election map on the ground that it was drawn to make sure one political party wins an outsize number of seats. The court has, however, left open the possibility that some kinds of political gamesmanship in redistricting may be too extreme.The problem, Justice Kennedy wrote in a 2004 concurrence, is that no one has devised “a workable standard” to decide when the political gerrymandering has crossed a constitutional line.On Tuesday, he pressed Erin E. Murphy, a lawyer for Wisconsin lawmakers, about whether a state law could require drawing districts to have the maximum number of votes for a given political party. Other justices followed up on the point, and Ms. Murphy gave equivocal answers.Justice Kennedy grew frustrated. “I have to say that I don’t think you ever answered the question,” he said.Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Ms. Murphy more fundamental questions.“Could you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering?” Justice Sotomayor asked. “How does that help our system of government?”Ms. Murphy said that gerrymandering “produces values in terms of accountability that are valuable so that the people understand who isn’t and who is in power.”That did not seem a sufficient reason, Justice Sotomayor said, “to stack the decks.”Much of the argument concerned various statistical tests for identifying extreme gerrymandering. Misha Tseytlin, Wisconsin’s solicitor general, said the challengers were relying on flimsy and hypothetical social science evidence.“Plaintiffs are asking this court to launch a redistricting revolution based upon their social science metrics,” he said.Chief Justice Roberts told Mr. Smith that courts are poorly equipped to evaluate social science data. “It may be simply my educational background,” the chief justice said of the studies before the court, “but I can only describe it as sociological gobbledygook.”Other justices seemed more comfortable with the studies.“This is not kind of hypothetical, airy-fairy, we guess, and then we guess again,” Justice Elena Kagan said. “I mean, this is pretty scientific by this point.”Justice Sotomayor said that “every single social science metric points in the same direction.”There may be close cases, Justice Kagan said, but this was not one of them. “This map goes pretty much over every line,” she said.Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in remarks that may have been aimed at Justice Kennedy, sketched out a series of criteria that he said amounted to a workable standard. He said courts should act only when there is one-party control of the state government and a map that creates a persistent and unjustified partisan advantage that is “an extreme outlier” when compared to other maps.“I suspect that that’s manageable,” Justice Breyer said.The case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, started when Republicans gained complete control of Wisconsin’s government in 2010 for the first time at the beginning of a redistricting cycle in more than 40 years. Lawmakers promptly drew a map for the State Assembly that helped Republicans convert very close statewide vote totals into lopsided legislative majorities.In 2012, after the redistricting, Republicans won 48.6 percent of the statewide vote for Assembly candidates but captured 60 of the Assembly’s 99 seats.Democratic voters sued, saying the maps violated the Constitution. “This is one of the most extreme gerrymanders ever drawn in living memory of the United States,” Mr. Smith said on Tuesday.The case is part of a larger debate over politics in redistricting, one that has taken on new urgency with the advent of sophisticated software. Both parties have engaged in partisan gerrymandering, but these days, Republicans have an advantage following a wave of victories in state legislatures that allowed lawmakers to draw election maps favoring their party.Some critics, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former governor of California, say districts should be drawn by independent commissions rather than politicians. Prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., are pushing to undo the redistricting gains Republicans made after the 2010 census when the next census is taken three years from now.Outside the court during the arguments, several dozen activists rallied with signs that read “Equal Districts Under Law” and “Hands off our Districts!”Mr. Schwarzenegger, who attended the argument, said afterward that he is hopeful that the justices will put a stop to partisan gerrymandering.“We are here today to ask the Supreme Court to fix something that the politicians will never do,” he said. “As Einstein said, those who created the problem will not be able to solve it.”Last year, a divided three-judge Federal District Court panel ruled that Republicans in Wisconsin had gone too far. The map, Judge Kenneth F. Ripple wrote for the majority, “was designed to make it more difficult for Democrats, compared to Republicans, to translate their votes into seats.”The decision was the first from a federal court in more than 30 years to reject a voting map as partisan gerrymandering.Wisconsin officials say that the lopsided representation of Republicans in the State Legislature is a product of geography rather than gerrymandering. Democrats have packed themselves into cities, effectively diluting their voting power, while Republicans are more evenly distributed across most states, the brief said.Judge Ripple acknowledged that the distribution of the population explains at least some part of the gap.“Wisconsin’s political geography, particularly the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban centers like Milwaukee and Madison, affords the Republican Party a natural, but modest, advantage in the districting process,” he wrote.But he added that partisan gerrymandering amplified that advantage."
"WASHINGTON — For lunch on April 26, Scott Pruitt, the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, dined with top executives from Southern Company, one of the nation’s largest coal-burning electric utilities, at Equinox, a white-tablecloth favorite of Washington power brokers.That evening, it was on to BLT Prime, a steakhouse inside the Trump International Hotel in Washington, for a meal with the board of directors of Alliance Resource Partners, a coal-mining giant whose chief executive donated nearly $2 million to help elect President Trump.Before those two agenda items, Mr. Pruitt met privately with top executives and lobbyists from General Motors to talk about their request to block an Obama administration move to curb  emissions that contribute to climate change.It was just a typical day for Mr. Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general. Since taking office in February, Mr. Trump’s E.P.A. chief has held back-to-back meetings, briefing sessions and speaking engagements almost daily with top corporate executives and lobbyists from all the major economic sectors that he regulates — and almost no meetings with environmental groups or consumer or public health advocates, according to a 320-page accounting of his daily schedule from February through May, the most detailed look yet at what Mr. Pruitt has been up to since he took over the agency.Many of those players have high-profile matters pending before the agency, with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in regulatory costs at stake. Some of these same companies and trade associations were allies of Mr. Pruitt when, as Oklahoma’s attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. at least 14 times to try to block rules Mr. Pruitt is now in charge of enforcing.He also took several trips home to Oklahoma for long weekends, often with one or two brief work meetings, followed by long stretches of downtime.E.P.A. officials defended Mr. Pruitt’s industry-heavy appointment book.“As E.P.A. has been the poster child for regulatory overreach, the agency is now meeting with those ignored by the Obama administration,” an emailed statement from the agency said, adding that the agency believed that The New York Times was making an “attempt to sensationalize for clicks” the administrator’s detailed calendar.But William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. administrator under the first President George Bush, described the level of meetings between Mr. Pruitt and industry executives as unusual.“My sense is there is almost nothing about this administration that is traditional,” Mr. Reilly said. He said Mr. Pruitt’s history of suing the E.P.A. should have prompted him to meet regularly with public health advocates and environmentalists.“I would think he would feel a responsibility to bend over backward to show a sense of judicious impartiality,” Mr. Reilly said.In just the first 15 days of May, Mr. Pruitt met with the chief executive of the Chemours Company, a leading chemical maker, as well as three chemical lobbying groups; the egg producers lobby; the president of Shell Oil Company; the chief executive of Southern Company; lobbyists for the farm bureau, the toy association and a cement association; the president of a truck equipment manufacturer seeking to roll back emissions regulations for trucks; and the president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.The E.P.A. leader also scheduled a call with the Family Research Council, whose self-described mission is to “advance faith, family and freedom in public policy and the culture from a Christian worldview.” The topic: pulling “together a small group of key business leaders around the country who are very excited about Administrator Pruitt’s new leadership role.”In recent weeks, Freedom of Information Act requests from environmentalists, other nonprofit groups and news organizations including The Washington Post have dislodged documents that hint at Mr. Pruitt’s typical day. But for the first time, the most recent release, based on an open records request by the liberal nonprofit American Oversight, includes a description of the topics discussed at each of the meetings, and a list of all the agency officials and corporate executives scheduled to attend.Mr. Pruitt also has made frequent, government-funded trips to his home state of Oklahoma, even when the journeys included only a bit of official business. A trip to Oklahoma on May 5, which cost $1,043, was justified by the E.P.A. as an “informational meeting.” It consisted of a one-hour sit-down that Friday with Sam Wade, the chief executive of the National Rural Water Association, then a return flight to Washington the following Monday.Mr. Pruitt flew to Oklahoma on May 19, a Friday, toured a chemical company for three hours the next day, then returned to Washington on Monday. The flight for that trip cost $2,122. These trips are being examined by the agency’s inspector general. In later trips Mr. Pruitt appears to have scheduled a greater number of meetings around trips to Oklahoma, such as a three-day trip in July during which he toured a Phillips 66 energy plant, spoke to the Chamber of Commerce in Tulsa, held a round table on the rollback of a Clean Water Act regulation and met with Gov. Mary Fallin.Mr. Pruitt generally takes commercial flights when he travels, records show, but on at least one occasion he flew on a much more expensive charter flight, and on two other occasions, on federal government and military planes, after getting authorization from agency officials.But many of Mr. Pruitt’s trips outside Washington, the records show, also involved speeches to industry groups and conservative activists who worked closely with the energy industry to challenge the Obama administration’s regulatory agenda.Destinations included the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort in Naples, Fla., in late April, where Mr. Pruitt spoke to the National Mining Association; the Phoenician, a golf resort and spa in Scottsdale, Ariz., where he spoke to the National Association of Manufacturers; and the Broadmoor, a Colorado Springs hotel, for a gathering of conservative activists, sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, where the agenda included sessions like “Innovative Ways to Roll Back the Administrative State.”The Times also examined more than a year’s worth of calendar records maintained for Gina McCarthy, Mr. Pruitt’s predecessor under President Barack Obama, which also demonstrated a partisan bent. Ms. McCarthy held a disproportionate number of meetings with Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, particularly in the summer of 2014, when the administration was making the case for sweeping climate-change regulations.But the documents show Ms. McCarthy apparently spent much more time meeting with E.P.A. professional staff and other federal government officials than Mr. Pruitt, discussing agency programs and policies. She also met with industry players, like the American Gas Association, the National Pork Producers Council and Edison Electric Institute, the utility lobby.One of Mr. Pruitt’s first scheduled meetings with a public health advocacy group, according to the calendar, came on May 24 when he sat down with the American Academy of Pediatrics. A day later he had two meetings with environmental activists, including a group called Trout Unlimited, a conservation group. Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said the agency (she would not specify who) had met with more than two dozen other health and environmental groups, including the Audubon Society and the American Lung Association.The newly released documents, for the first time, create a direct link between Mr. Pruitt’s meetings and actions that the industry wants him to take.The oil and gas industry, for example, opposed an Obama-era rule that required it to collect information on the emission of methane, a gas that is considered at least 25 times as effective at warming the planet as carbon dioxide.On March 27, A.J. Ferate, the vice president of regulatory affairs at the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, saw Mr. Pruitt for half an hour in the administrator’s office to offer, according to the schedule notes, “just a few words of appreciation for canceling the Information Collection Request (ICR) on the oil and gas industry.” Mr. Ferate and Mr. Pruitt had been working together since at least 2011 — when Mr. Pruitt was Oklahoma’s attorney general — to try to kill the methane rule.The calendars show how companies often turn to people with close personal ties to Mr. Trump or Mr. Pruitt to set up meetings. Roy W. Bailey, the Texas co-finance chairman for the Trump campaign, helped organize a meeting for Intrexon, a Maryland company that wants E.P.A. approval for a biotech-based mosquito control system. Jessica M. Garrison, a former consultant to the Republican Attorneys General Association, helped set up the lunch that Mr. Pruitt had at Equinox with electric utility executives.The schedule also includes a number of meetings with automakers who pressed the Trump administration to roll back Mr. Obama’s decision to lock in vehicle emissions rules through 2025. Mr. Pruitt met in his office on March 17 with the chairman of BMW, Harald Krüger. On April 27, Mr. Pruitt met with G.M. a second time, along with nine other automakers represented by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The topic: “key E.P.A. priorities affecting the auto industry.”Mr. Pruitt in late April welcomed five executives from a trade association representing sorghum cereal grain growers, including their lobbyist, Joe Bischoff, a former official at the Department of Agriculture. The message they offered Mr. Pruitt: The industry had “witnessed significant pesticide-related restrictions and the threat of revocation of more than half of the crop’s reliable insecticides.”Representatives from CropLife America, a trade association run by giant pesticide companies such as Dow AgroSciences and Bayer CropScience, separately met with Mr. Pruitt to “acknowledge the many actions taken already to correct recent regulatory overreach.” The meeting with CropLife came the day after Mr. Pruitt overruled E.P.A. scientists who had recommended that the agency ban a pesticide named chlorpyrifos, which has been blamed, in E.P.A.-funded research, for causing developmental disabilities in children, particularly among the families of farm workers.Another theme emerges in the calendar: Industry executives and conservative activists often scored meetings to press Mr. Pruitt to kill or modify Obama-era climate change regulations, particularly the so-called Clean Power Plan. A May 18 conference call included representatives from the State Policy Network and American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization with ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialists.“Many people on this call were leading the Clean Power Plan pushback in their state and are advocates for devolving decision making to the local level,” the calendar notes.The E.P.A. is expected to issue a legal justification and plan for rescinding the Clean Power Plan as soon as this week."
"WASHINGTON — Top congressional Republicans, who have for decades resisted any legislative limits on guns, signaled on Wednesday that they would be open to banning the firearm accessory that the Las Vegas gunman used to transform his rifles to mimic automatic weapon fire.For a generation, Republicans in Congress — often joined by conservative Democrats — have bottled up gun legislation, even as the carnage of mass shootings grew ever more gruesome and the weaponry ever more deadly. A decade ago, they blocked efforts to limit the size of magazines after the massacre at Virginia Tech. Five years later, Republican leaders thwarted bipartisan legislation to expand background checks of gun purchasers after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Last year, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub massacre, they blocked legislation to stop gun sales to buyers on terrorism watch lists.But in this week’s massacre in Las Vegas, lawmakers in both parties may have found the part of the weapons trade that few could countenance: previously obscure gun conversion kits, called “bump stocks,” that turn semiautomatic weapons into weapons capable of firing in long, deadly bursts.“I own a lot of guns, and as a hunter and sportsman, I think that’s our right as Americans, but I don’t understand the use of this bump stock,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said, adding, “It seems like it’s an obvious area we ought to explore and see if it’s something Congress needs to act on.”Mr. Cornyn said the continuing legality of the conversion kits was “a legitimate question,” and told reporters he had asked Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Judiciary Committee chairman, to convene a hearing on that issue and any others that arise out of the Las Vegas investigation.Other Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, said they would be open to considering legislation on bump stocks.“We certainly want to learn more details on what occurred in Las Vegas,” Mr. Rubio said, “and if there are vulnerabilities in federal law that we should be addressing to prevent such attacks in the future, we would always be open to that.”In the House, Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, said he was drafting bipartisan legislation banning the conversion kits. Representative Mark Meadows, the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, also said he would be open to considering a bill, while Representative Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, called for an outright ban.“I think they should be banned,” Mr. Flores told the newspaper The Hill. “There’s no reason for a typical gun owner to own anything that converts a semiautomatic to something that behaves like an automatic.”In an often deadlocked Washington, none of the pronouncements guaranteed action. The National Rifle Association, which has poured tens of millions of dollars into Republican campaign coffers, remained mum on the bump stock discussion and could stop it cold.And Erich Pratt, executive director of another gun rights group, Gun Owners of America, vowed to block any legislation.“We see this as an item that is certainly protected by the Second Amendment, and realistically, they are already on the market, so passing a law banning them isn’t going to stop bad guys like this creep in Las Vegas,” he said.But Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, tried to force the issue, introducing legislation, backed by about two dozen Democrats, that would ban bump stocks.Ms. Feinstein cautioned that bipartisan support for such narrow legislation would hardly constitute a sea change. She tried to ban bump stocks in 2013, but that was part of broader legislation to renew the assault weapons ban, which went nowhere.“I mean, if not this, what?” she asked. “It doesn’t take a weapon away. It just means you can’t convert it into something it’s not meant to be.”At a hastily convened news conference, Ms. Feinstein said the Las Vegas massacre, which left 58 people dead and about 500 injured at a country music festival Sunday night, had hit home with her. Her daughter had planned to attend the concert but decided against going at the last minute.Ms. Feinstein, who has spent years shepherding gun safety legislation — almost always unsuccessfully — said she introduced the measure on the advice of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who reasoned that by offering a narrowly tailored provision, she might get Republican support.Bump stocks replace a rifle’s standard stock, which is the part held against the shoulder, freeing the weapon to slide back and forth rapidly, harnessing the energy from the kickback that shooters feel when the weapon fires. The stock “bumps” back and forth between the shooter’s shoulder and trigger finger, causing the rifle to rapidly fire again and again, far faster than an unaided finger can pull a trigger.In marketing the devices, two Texas companies, Bump Fire Systems and Slide Fire Solutions, were apparently concerned that they would not be legal. But in June 2010, after an inquiry from Slide Fire, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or A.T.F., sent a letter saying that the company’s bump stock product “is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.”The Las Vegas gunman fired down on concertgoers from the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel. With his fixed firing positions and distance from his victims, he almost certainly was more lethal because of the conversion kits. But until the shooting, many lawmakers said, they had never heard of bump stocks.The devices were introduced during the past decade by Bump Fire and Slide Fire, both based in Moran, Tex., near Abilene. Bump Fire’s website appeared to be down for much of Wednesday. The company wrote on its Facebook page on Tuesday that its servers had been overwhelmed by “high traffic volume.”Multiple items on Slide Fire’s site on Wednesday featured the notice, “Due to extreme high demands, we are currently out of stock.”Bump Fire sells stocks for an AK-47 and an AR-15 for $99.99 each. Slide Fire’s stocks are priced between $140 and $300. Neither company responded to a request for comment.On Gunbroker.com, an auction site for firearms and shooting accessories, at least three dozen listings featuring bump stocks had attracted multiple bids.Zack Cernok, a Pennsylvania gun owner, was one of those trying to buy a Bump Fire bump stock.“I don’t even have the gun for it, but I want the stock just to have it down the line,” he said. “I just like the idea of them and want to see how it feels and if it’s worth it — for $100, it’s almost not a bad investment to buy it, try it out and sell it if I don’t like it.”"

"LAS VEGAS — President Trump comforted the victims of Sunday’s deadly mass shooting and paid tribute to those who tended to them, taking up on Wednesday a harrowing duty of the modern presidency that has nevertheless become numbing in its regularity.After touring the wreckage of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico a day earlier, a somber Mr. Trump headed to Las Vegas, where 58 people were slain by an assailant raining bullets into a crowded country music festival from the blown-out window of his hotel room high above them.“What I saw today is just an incredible tribute to professionalism, and what they have done is incredible. And you never want to see it again,” Mr. Trump said, after spending about an hour talking to patients in the trauma center of a Las Vegas hospital that received 100 people in the hours after the shooting.“We met patients that were absolutely, terribly wounded,” the president added. “And the doctors, the nurses, all of the people at the hospital, have done a job that is indescribable.”In a four-hour visit to this bereaved city, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania, also toured the operations center of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which coordinated the response to the shooting. On one wall hung a poster with an aerial view of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where the gunman perched, and the site of the music festival below it.“This is a rough time,” Mr. Trump told the assembled police officers, some of whom had risked gunfire to direct the concertgoers toward safety. “But if you didn’t get up there so quickly, it could have been worse — a lot worse.”The president referred to the gunman, Stephen Paddock, who killed himself in his hotel room before the police burst in on him, as “a sick, demented man.” He asked Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of Clark County if investigators had any new information on Mr. Paddock. The sheriff demurred in front of cameras but said that the police were following several leads.“There might be something there,” Mr. Trump replied. “Wires are screwed up, but there might be something there.”As the president was flying to Las Vegas, tensions inside his administration erupted back in Washington. On Air Force One, televisions displayed Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s statement denying an NBC News report that he had been talked out of resigning by Vice President Mike Pence and refusing to comment on whether he had called Mr. Trump a “moron.”At the hospital, the president dismissed the report as “fake news” and a “made-up story.” He said he was honored by Mr. Tillerson’s statement, adding, “I have total confidence in Rex.” Earlier, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, declined to say whether the secretary of state had been instructed by the White House to deliver his statement.Mr. Trump has been uncharacteristically subdued about the Las Vegas shooting, one of the deadliest in American history. He has said little about it on Twitter and deflected questions about the killer’s motives, in contrast to previous mass shootings, which have drawn quick, furious reactions from him, particularly when the attackers were Muslim.With no evidence yet linking Mr. Paddock to militant Islamic groups, the Las Vegas attack appears unlike those in Orlando, Fla., or San Bernardino, Calif., both of which Mr. Trump seized on, as a candidate, to justify his ban on people from predominantly Muslim countries. He also used those earlier shootings to highlight the scourge of what he labels “radical Islamic terror.”For Mr. Trump, the political subtext of Las Vegas has more to do with gun control laws, which he campaigned against in 2016. On Wednesday, the president said this was not the moment to talk about new legislation, but a day earlier, he said, “We’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.”That appeared to open the door at least a crack — enough to rattle opponents of gun control. Breitbart News, the far-right website run by Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, said his political base would not tolerate the president’s softening his line on gun rights.Mr. Bannon had told colleagues that he planned to keep Mr. Trump “under a microscope” while he was in Las Vegas to make sure he did not signal any further flexibility on gun legislation.Mr. Trump remained on familiar ground on Wednesday by focusing on the police and other law enforcement officials, whom he has repeatedly praised for quickly tracking down Mr. Paddock in his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay.But he also played what, for him, is a less comfortable role: that of the nation’s chief consoler. In reacting to other tragedies, Mr. Trump has struggled to convey empathy, defaulting to anger at the assailants, or, as in the case of the recent hurricanes, praise for his government’s response.On Tuesday in Puerto Rico, Mr. Trump delivered huzzahs for the military, his cabinet and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But his interactions with storm survivors were an awkward mix of campaign-style high jinks. At one point, the president tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd, and he also told officials of Puerto Rico’s debt-ridden administration that they have “thrown our budget a little out of whack.”On Wednesday, Mr. Trump stuck to a presidential script in speaking about Las Vegas. Standing alongside Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada and other state and local officials, Mr. Trump recounted stories of individual heroism by police officers. He appealed to the nation, as he had in a statement on Monday, to seek love over hate.“Our souls are stricken with grief for every American who lost a husband or a wife, a mother or a father, a son or a daughter,” Mr. Trump declared, speaking from a prepared text. But, he added, “we cannot be defined by the evil that threatens us or the violence that incites such terror.”“In the darkest moments,” he said, “what shines most brightly is the goodness that thrives in the hearts of our people.”It is not a reflexive message for a president who has often exploited divisions in American society. After previous shootings, Mr. Trump zeroed in on the role of Muslims, or accused opponents like Hillary Clinton of advocating wide-open immigration policies.Still, presidents with different politics and temperaments have also struggled with how to respond to mass shootings. Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, wept when he spoke of the 2012 slaughter of children at a Connecticut elementary school, and he sang the hymn “Amazing Grace” when he eulogized the black parishioners gunned down in 2015 in a church in Charleston, S.C.After Congress failed to enact legislation in the aftermath of the shootings in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama shed tears again — this time in anger at a political establishment he said was in thrall to the National Rifle Association.But late in his presidency, after police officers were shot in Dallas, a weary Mr. Obama spoke of feeling that he had run out of words to adequately express either sorrow or resolve in the face of such relentless violence.If anything, gun control laws currently are even more elusive. That leaves Mr. Trump with the unenviable prospect of more hospital visits and memorial services."
"WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Wednesday to approve $29 billion in additional hurricane relief and debt forgiveness, seeking to help Puerto Rico and other battered areas and to shore up the troubled federal program that provides flood insurance to homes and small businesses.The request came nearly a month after lawmakers approved a first installment of $15 billion in disaster relief, taking action after Hurricane Harvey caused devastation in Texas and while Hurricane Irma was heading toward Florida. Many more billions of dollars in aid requests are likely to come as Puerto Rico and other areas assess the damage from this year’s hurricanes.The latest request seeks $12.8 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stay current with the nearly $200 million a day the agency is spending on recovery work. It also asks for lawmakers to wipe out $16 billion in debt that the National Flood Insurance Program owes to the Treasury and has no immediate way to repay.Under the White House proposal, premiums for flood insurance would rise, at least for homeowners who could afford to pay more, while private insurers would be encouraged to start writing their own flood insurance.In addition, the White House is also seeking $577 million in response to wildfires that have been prevalent this year in Western states, and is calling for efforts to limit the cost and devastation of wildfires.“With two more months of hurricane season remaining and wildfires continuing to burn in the West, we must act expeditiously to ensure that communities have the assistance they need, when they need it,” wrote President Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in a letter to congressional leaders on Wednesday.The first installment of disaster relief, approved in September, was part of a bigger fiscal deal that Mr. Trump struck with the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. That deal also provided funding for the government until December, and it included a short-term extension of the debt limit.It was not immediately clear how and when the latest disaster relief request would be handled by lawmakers. The Senate has planned a recess next week, and the House has one scheduled for the following week.The National Flood Insurance Program was already deep in debt before this year’s hurricanes, and it has now reached its $30.4 billion borrowing limit, a spokeswoman for FEMA said on Wednesday.The program had to start borrowing from the Treasury in 2005, when it needed $17.5 billion in fresh cash to pay big flood claims filed after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In 2012, it borrowed another $6.25 billion to pay claims filed after Hurricane Sandy. As now structured, the program has no way to repay the Treasury, and is carrying the debt forward on its books, year after year.Private insurance companies get the money they need to pay claims by charging policy holders premiums and building up carefully calculated reserves. The National Flood Insurance Program charges premiums, too, but most experts agree they have fallen far behind the rising cost of repairing homes and businesses after catastrophic flooding.As of this week, the program had just $5.8 billion available to pay claims, the FEMA spokeswoman said. More than 88,000 claims have been submitted from Hurricane Harvey, and more than 27,000 from Irma.Asking lawmakers to take action on the program’s debt, Mr. Mulvaney wrote that the hurricanes had “inflicted projected losses of $16 billion,” and that without fresh money, the program will have exhausted its resources and be unable to pay claims “by the latter part of this month.”Fiscal conservatives in Congress, especially those from states without much flooding, may object to the debt forgiveness because it means the taxpayers they represent will not be repaid for helping to pay flood claims in Louisiana, Texas, New York and New Jersey.To make the taxpayer losses more palatable, the White House also proposed on Wednesday to raise flood insurance premiums, at least for homeowners who can afford them, and to make changes that would allow insurance companies to underwrite flood insurance themselves.Currently, insurance companies can sell flood insurance, but they do not pay the claims with their own money. Instead, they collect fees for marketing and administering the policies and pass the risk on to the federal government.“The N.F.I.P. is simply not fiscally sustainable in its present form,” Mr. Mulvaney said in his letter. He said the proposed changes would help “to place it on a sound financial footing.”Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has been pressing for changes to the program, but lawmakers have been unwilling to impose higher premiums on constituents in flood zones.Democrats in Congress have been pressing the administration to step up its response to Hurricane Maria, expressing grave concerns about the humanitarian crisis it caused in Puerto Rico.On Wednesday, Mr. Schumer described the new request for disaster relief as “a good start.”“However, Republicans should not put much-needed aid at risk by insisting on the proposed ideological changes to the flood insurance program and forest management policy,” he said. “Those changes should be debated separately from this aid package.”Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said his committee would put forward legislation “as soon as possible.”“It is abundantly clear that the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are in need of more help — in dollars, in resources, in manpower and in federal support,” Mr. Frelinghuysen said.“This will be a long process,” he added, “and this next round of funds certainly won’t be all that is needed.”Mr. Trump visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday, almost two weeks after Maria hit the island on Sept. 20. While there, he brought up the cost of the storm.“I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack, because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, and that’s fine,” the president said. “We’ve saved a lot of lives.”"
"WASHINGTON — When Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson traveled to Saudi Arabia with President Trump last spring, he impressed hosts and visitors alike by swaying along with the traditional men’s dancers swathed in white robes and brandishing swords. “Not my first sword dance,” Mr. Tillerson deadpanned afterward.Indeed, the calculation behind Mr. Tillerson’s appointment was that he could parlay decades of experience as an oil executive brokering deals in the Middle East and elsewhere into success in the nation’s top diplomatic post. But as Mr. Tillerson has discovered, the most important target of any secretary of state’s diplomacy is the president he serves.Now the man brandishing the sword is Mr. Trump, who holds it over Mr. Tillerson’s neck, poised to swing at any moment. The relationship between the two men has grown so acidic that Mr. Tillerson felt compelled to call an extraordinary news conference on Wednesday to deny that he was thinking of resigning — a move that paradoxically only increased speculation that he might in fact resign, of his own free will or not.Even if he stays, Mr. Tillerson is now a wounded figure, his credibility at home and abroad diminished by the perception that he does not have a close alignment with the president. Foreign leaders and diplomats may doubt that he truly represents the administration or that his assurances will stick. A countdown clock has been set, ticking away toward what many assume is the inevitable departure.“Tillerson has good instincts on many foreign policy issues and is ready to provide independent advice,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime State Department peace negotiator now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “Despite Tillerson’s efforts to project the fact that it’s all one big happy family, however, the road ahead with a president who consistently undercuts him publicly won’t be easy.”Michael Doran, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who served in several national security positions under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump has made clear that staying on the same page as his top advisers is not a priority. In some cases, he said, that may provide value in forging a “good cop, bad cop” strategy that gives Mr. Tillerson leverage to demand more in negotiations with other countries.“But most of the work of government must be carried out by subordinates, not by the president himself,” said Mr. Doran. “So it’s hard to see how an approach that erodes the authority of top advisers will pay off in the long run.”Still, while many in Washington point to Mr. Trump’s divisive management style, Mr. Tillerson has little reservoir of good will left in the capital. He was already judged “the nation’s least influential top diplomat in recent memory,” as Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, the conservative journal, put it. He has alienated his own department with deep budget cuts and a diffident style while never bringing in a full team of his own. He has made few friends in Congress or the foreign policy establishment. He has maintained such a low profile that his clout was doubted from the start.Some see him as a brake on an undisciplined president eager to tear down international relationships, part of a “grown ups” triumvirate along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, cast Mr. Tillerson as one of those standing between the United States and “chaos.”But other than Mr. Corker, few rushed to Mr. Tillerson’s defense in recent days, reflecting a larger disappointment with him.Mr. Tillerson was an unconventional choice for the job in the first place. While he spent 41 years at Exxon Mobil, working his way up to chief executive of the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company, he was the first secretary of state in American history without prior experience in government, politics or the military, working for the nation’s first president also without such a background.No matter how often successful business leaders like Mr. Tillerson assume they can master the public sector just as they did the private sector, government rarely submits to the will of the new master. At Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson was the undisputed chief whose orders were not to be ignored and who had no need to engage the public if he chose not to. After 10 years running one of the largest companies on the planet, he was unaccustomed to the role of subordinate. And Mr. Trump does not make it easy for anyone to make that transition.The most successful secretaries of state were those with close working relationships with their presidents, like Dean Acheson under Harry Truman, John Foster Dulles under Dwight D. Eisenhower, Henry A. Kissinger under Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, and George P. Shultz under Ronald Reagan. Condoleezza Rice was so close to Mr. Bush that she was seen as the most influential member of the administration in his second term.“The ideal situation is where there is a direct and close relationship with the president whereby the secretary of state is seen as the primary spokesperson of the president and the administration on foreign policy,” said Edward P. Djerejian, a longtime diplomat and director of Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “This means the president has to empower the secretary of state in this role.”No secretary of state was as close to his president as James A. Baker III, who had been a personal friend of the elder George Bush for decades since their days as tennis doubles partners at the Houston Country Club. “Nobody was going to get between me and my president,” Mr. Baker said repeatedly.Other secretaries who could not reconcile themselves with their presidents did not fare as well. William Jennings Bryan quit in protest of Woodrow Wilson’s policies leading to entry in World War I, while Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of Jimmy Carter’s decision to mount what was ultimately a failed military operation to rescue American hostages in Iran. Colin L. Powell was boxed out by rivals under the younger Mr. Bush and left unhappily. John Kerry was not close to Barack Obama but ultimately won support from his president for his Iran nuclear deal.Probably the most disastrous relationship between a president and secretary of state in modern times came when Mr. Reagan named Alexander M. Haig Jr. to the post in 1981. Friction started on Inauguration Day when Mr. Haig, still wearing a morning coat from the ceremony, strode into the Oval Office with an order he wanted Mr. Reagan to sign granting him sweeping authority. Mr. Reagan declined and friction only grew. Mr. Haig threatened to resign repeatedly until one day, to his surprise, Mr. Reagan accepted.At his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson expressed bafflement at the ways of the capital, in particular when pressed over reports he had derided Mr. Trump as a “moron.”“This is what I don’t understand about Washington,” he said. “I’m not from this place. But the places I come from, we don’t deal with that kind of petty nonsense. And it is intended to do nothing but divide people.”Mr. Tillerson did not deny using the word “moron” to describe Mr. Trump, although his spokeswoman later did on his behalf. Inside the White House, many discounted that denial and assumed that he did in fact say it.Philip D. Zelikow, a University of Virginia history professor who was Ms. Rice’s counselor at the State Department, said foreign governments have already taken their measure of Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson. “The impact,” he said, “is likely to be more internal, within the administration, adding that much more acid to the corrosive drip.”Sword dancing, as it turns out, can be hazardous to one’s health."
"WASHINGTON — The House took the first major legislative step Thursday toward enacting a promised overhaul of the tax code, approving a budget blueprint that would allow a future tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes.The House voted 219 to 206 to pass the budget resolution, with 18 Republicans voting against it.The belated approval of a spending and revenue blueprint for the fiscal year that began on Sunday offered a momentary display of Republican cohesion as the party moves ahead in its attempt to overhaul the tax code for the first time since Ronald Reagan was president.The document itself ostensibly charts a path toward a balanced budget over the next 10 years, giving Republicans something to offer their core conservative voters while providing Democrats with new lines of attack in the 2018 midterm elections.But few people believe the broad spending road map will lead anywhere. What is important is parliamentary language that would shield a tax bill from a filibuster in the Senate. A week after Republicans conceded defeat in their attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, that constituted a step forward in their new legislative quest.“Our budget is the golden key that unlocks pro-growth tax reform,” said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee.For Republican lawmakers still looking for a major legislative achievement in the Trump era, the hard part still remains. President Trump and Republicans in Congress need to agree on the contents of a bill to overhaul the tax code, a daunting task.Democrats offered a starkly different take on the budget resolution, arguing that Republicans were clearing the way for a partisan tax plan that would benefit the rich.“I was elected not just to represent millionaires, but to represent aspiring millionaires, working families, seniors, veterans,” said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “And for all of them, for anyone who isn’t already a millionaire, this budget is a slap in the face.”To ease passage of a tax overhaul, the blueprint passed by the House includes language that would allow for a tax bill to be considered under special procedures in the Senate. That approach would allow approval of the bill with only 50 votes, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie, rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Republicans have only 52 seats in the Senate.“We’re united in getting tax reform legislation to the president’s desk this year,” said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “But if we do not pass a budget, tax reform doesn’t move forward.”Republicans followed the same approach in their attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But in that effort, they could never come up with a repeal measure that 50 Republican senators would support.The same challenge looms now that the subject is taxes.After facing pressure from lawmakers, Republican leaders are already backing away from a proposal to fully repeal the deduction for state and local taxes. Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said the proposal to do away with that deduction, which is widely used in his state, was one of the main reasons he voted against the budget resolution on Thursday.“I have confidence that leadership understands our concerns,” Mr. Lance said.In the House this week, Republicans heralded the budget resolution as a step toward fiscal responsibility. The blueprint charts a course toward erasing annual budget deficits by the end of a decade, calling for trillions of dollars in spending cuts and sketching out major changes to Medicare and Medicaid.“Our national debt continues to grow exponentially every day, every hour, every minute and every second,” said Representative Todd Rokita, Republican of Indiana, as he encouraged his colleagues to support the budget resolution and tackle “the spending crisis that we’re in.”But the changes called for in coming years are only aspirational. For the fiscal year that just started, Republicans and Democrats still need to reach a deal to fund the government beginning in December, when a stopgap spending measure is set to expire.On Thursday, lawmakers from Texas sent a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees seeking $18.7 billion in additional disaster relief in response to Hurricane Harvey, underscoring how fluid the spending side of the budget is.The budget resolution is also a political document, and its approval provided fodder to Democrats, who warned about the ramifications of the Republican plan.Representative Anthony G. Brown, Democrat of Maryland, said Republicans were seeking to balance the budget “on the backs of students, workers, seniors, the disabled and vulnerable communities in Maryland and across our country.”“And for what?” he asked. “To provide tax cuts to the top 1 percent?”The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also seized on the budget resolution, highlighting, in a new online ad, the reduction in Medicare spending that is called for by the budget resolution.The Senate Budget Committee unveiled its own budget resolution last week, and the panel approved it on Thursday, hours after the House passed its own budget blueprint.To secure parliamentary protection, the House and Senate will need to agree on an identical budget resolution. Right now, their proposals have key differences.The House version calls for a tax plan that would not add to the deficit. And in a nod to fiscal conservatives eager to rein in federal spending, it instructs House committees to find at least about $200 billion in savings.The Senate version, on the other hand, would allow a tax bill that adds up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade. And Senate Republicans have shown no eagerness to pursue spending cuts as they go about trying to pass a tax bill."
"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed Randal K. Quarles as the Federal Reserve’s vice chairman for supervision, an important victory for the Trump administration in its campaign to ease some financial regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Quarles is the first person to officially hold the position, created after the crisis to sharpen the Fed’s focus on financial stability and regulation. As a governor on the Fed’s board, Mr. Quarles will also vote on monetary policy. Daniel K. Tarullo, who stepped down from the Fed earlier this year, was the Fed’s point man on regulation but was never confirmed as vice chairman.The vote, 65 to 32, ensures that the Fed will still have four governors on its seven-seat board after its vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, steps down later this month. The Trump administration has not nominated candidates for the three remaining vacancies.President Trump also must decide whether to replace or renominate the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, when her term ends in February.Mr. Quarles said at his confirmation hearing in July that the government should relax some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry since 2008. The Trump administration argues that regulation is impeding lending and economic growth.“Regulatory policies enacted since the financial crisis have improved the safety and soundness of the financial system,” Mr. Quarles said. “But as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order.”That view puts him at odds with Ms. Yellen, who gave a forceful defense of the new regulations in an August speech, saying that people were forgetting the lessons of the financial crisis and that the new rules had strengthened the financial system.Mr. Quarles will oversee the Fed’s annual “stress testing” of large banks, which is intended to ensure that banks have the financial strength to weather unexpected events. Those tests are critical to banks’ ability to increase dividends and return capital to shareholders since they must pass the test to get their capital plans approved. Mr. Quarles said in July that he favored disclosing more information about the tests, a step long sought by the banking industry but opposed by Mr. Tarullo, who warned that transparency could allow banks to “game the system.”“I do think the Fed can look at being more transparent about those activities and do it in a way that doesn’t reduce the effectiveness of those tests,” Mr. Quarles said.He will also play a role in evaluating the “living wills” that large banks must submit to demonstrate that, in the event of failure, their businesses could be wound down without requiring government assistance. Here, too, the banks have grappled with regulators over the stringency of the requirements.And he must wrestle with which banks deserve tougher Fed scrutiny. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law requires banks with assets of more than $50 billion to face a stricter set of rules. While there is a consensus that the government should ease the regulatory burden on community banks and limit the most stringent regulations to the very largest financial institutions, writing new rules remains a challenge. Some within the industry, including big bank trade groups, want the Fed to use a “risk-based” assessment, versus a size threshold, to determine which banks warrant tougher scrutiny. Other banks, particularly smaller regional firms, say the threshold should be raised to $250 billion from $50 billion. The Fed has already eased the qualitative provision of the stress tests on banks with less than $250 billion in assets.Mr. Quarles is less likely to have an immediate influence on monetary policy, but he has criticized the Fed for trying too hard to stimulate the economy, and he is expected to favor raising interest rates more quickly.He said at his confirmation hearing that the Fed should adopt a mathematical formula for determining the proper level of its benchmark rate. Some conservatives say that such a rule would make Fed policy more stable and predictable, which in turn would benefit the economy. But the idea is strongly opposed by the rest of the Fed’s board, which argues that rules are helpful as references, but that policy making ultimately requires discretion.Mr. Quarles, 60, is a lawyer by training who worked in the financial industry before joining the Treasury Department in 2002 as assistant secretary for international affairs under President George W. Bush. He later served as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving public service in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group and then helped to found the Cynosure Group, a private equity firm based in Utah.He is related by marriage to Marriner S. Eccles, the Fed’s chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the building where Mr. Quarles will now have an office."
"WASHINGTON — Rising exports and falling imports shrank the United States’ trade deficit in goods and services to the lowest level in nearly a year, data released Thursday by the Commerce Department showed.The trade deficit — the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports — narrowed to $42.4 billion in August, down $1.2 billion from July. Exports for the month were $195.3 billion, while imports came to $237.7 billion. The nation’s trade deficits with China and the European Union both shrank in August.Josh Feinman, the chief economist of Deutsche Asset Management, said those trends were largely the result of a strengthening global economy that buoyed American exports, as well as the weakening of the value of the dollar.“Global growth is looking better,” Mr. Feinman said. “That does create a little bit of a tailwind for exports.” He cautioned that the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, could be distorting the data somewhat, as ports closed and people stayed home from work and shops.Despite the narrowing in August, the overall trade deficit is still growing on an annual basis. It was up 8.8 percent in the first eight months from the same period in 2016, according to Commerce Department data.President Trump has often pointed to the trade deficit as evidence that the United States is not benefiting from global trade in the way that it should. He has promised that his America-first policy will help shrink the gap, consistently citing deficits with other countries as a sign that the United States is losing when it comes to global trade. And he has typically blamed trade agreements and negotiators for failing to achieve the best terms for American exporters.The administration has commissioned a comprehensive report on the state of significant trade deficits, which has not yet been released to the public.Economists caution against reading too much into the trade deficit, particularly monthly swings, as a measure of the administration’s success in giving America the economic upper hand. That’s because the trade deficit is closely linked with multiple macroeconomic factors including like the relative growth rates of countries, the value of currencies, the strength of the dollar as a global reserve currency, and global trends in savings and investment.A better measure of success for Mr. Trump’s America-first policy, economists say, would be putting more Americans to work, and rising growth and productivity gains over all.In an emailed response, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said such macroeconomic factors did not explain the huge increase in the trade deficits the United States has seen with other countries in the past: China immediately after its admission to the World Trade Organization, Mexico after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed or South Korea after the United States signed a trade deal with that country.“China’s trade surplus is what has fueled their economic growth for many years,” he wrote. “If a trade surplus is good for China how can a trade deficit be anything but bad for us?”Many economists do not see the trade gap as a negative. Bryan Riley, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who supports free trade, said the trade deficit was not necessarily a sign of trouble but can be good or bad, depending on the circumstances. Mr. Riley pointed out that in recent years, the economy has grown faster when the trade deficit was getting bigger, and slower when it was getting smaller.Mr. Riley said the administration’s tax policies might have a greater impact than trade policy on the trade deficit if changes to the tax code end up making the United States economy more competitive and attract more investment.While the Trump administration would consider such tax changes to be a success, Mr. Riley said they could make the trade deficit even bigger — if, for example, lower taxes expand economic growth, giving Americans more money to buy goods from abroad, or encourage foreigners to invest more in the United States.Not every economist thinks that a trade deficit is harmless. Some, especially those on the left, see persistent imbalances as a potentially troubling sign that the United States has lost manufacturing jobs to other countries.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden, said that while the president should not look to trade deficits as a “scorecard” from month to month, Mr. Trump “was onto something” with his intuition that persistent trade deficits reflected a structural problem of fewer goods being produced in the United States.But Mr. Bernstein agreed that it would be difficult for the president’s actions to have much influence on trade flows, which are determined by broader economic factors. He predicted that the country’s trade balance when Mr. Trump leaves office would be pretty similar to what it was when he came in. As powerful as the president and economic policy can be, they pale in comparison with millions of American consumers and producers — and the multinational supply chains that have long existed to serve those needs.“Cargo ships aren’t going to disappear because of saber rattling,” Mr. Bernstein said. “You actually have to implement pretty drastic policies to disrupt these flows, which are embedded in the global economy. The things you’ve heard them talking about are pretty marginal.”That seems unlikely to dissuade Mr. Trump from citing the metric. On Monday, he told Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister of Thailand, that he wanted to reduce the trade deficit with that country. “I think we’re going to try and sell a little bit more to you now,” the president said."
"WASHINGTON — Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, announced Wednesday night that he would not seek re-election in 2018 after a backlash over reports that he had suggested to his lover to consider having an abortion.In a statement, Mr. Murphy, 65, an outspoken opponent of abortion who has served in the House since 2003, said his decision to retire came after discussions with his family and staff. Mr. Murphy was uncontested in his 2016 campaign for the heavily Republican district in western Pennsylvania that includes parts of Pittsburgh.“In the coming weeks I will take personal time to seek help as my family and I continue to work through our personal difficulties and seek healing,” Mr. Murphy said in the statement. “I ask you to respect our privacy during this time.”Mr. Murphy, who is married with an adult daughter, admitted several weeks ago to having an extramarital affair with Shannon Edwards, a forensic psychologist, that began in 2016. The allegations surfaced after a court unsealed records in the divorce case between Dr. Edwards, 32, and her former husband.This week, text messages obtained by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette showed that Mr. Murphy had urged Dr. Edwards to consider having an abortion during a pregnancy scare. Dr. Edwards, who later determined that she was not pregnant, denounced the congressman for his hypocrisy in the messages.On Tuesday, Mr. Murphy joined House Republicans in passing a bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, a measure that passed 237 to 189. Mr. Murphy, a member of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, was also a co-sponsor of the legislation, known as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.Mr. Murphy last month acknowledged the affair with “a personal friend” after it was revealed by the newspaper.“This is nobody’s fault but my own, and I offer no excuses,” Mr. Murphy said in a statement then. “To the extent that there should be any blame in this matter, it falls solely upon me.”In a statement on Wednesday, Representative Steve Stivers, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he was “extremely disappointed in the circumstances” that led to Mr. Murphy’s announced retirement. Mr. Stivers, of Ohio, said he would work with “the eventual Republican nominee to ensure the district’s conservative values are represented in Congress.”Three Democrats have already announced campaigns for Mr. Murphy’s seat: Mike Crossey, a former teachers’ union official and Allegheny County councilman; Pam Iovino, a Navy veteran and former Department of Veterans Affairs official; and Bob Solomon, an emergency doctor."
"Pettiness, such pettiness, in this noxious swamp of maybe-morons.“I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters on Wednesday, declining to refute an NBC report that he had privately called President Trump a “moron” this year. “This is what I don’t understand about Washington. Again, I’m not from this place. But the places I come from, we don’t deal with that kind of petty nonsense.”There was no immediate estimate available for the collective pettiness of Texas, where Mr. Tillerson was raised, nor of the oil industry, where he spent his career until Mr. Trump summoned him to the pettiness hub along the Potomac.But for a certain class of Washington denizen, Mr. Tillerson’s slight opened a new front in the nation’s forever-war against the reputation of its capital. The thrashing of Washington culture by voters, nonvoters, members of Congress — that much is a sacred rite.A sitting secretary of state, at odds with his president and blaming the city’s trifling instincts for stoking tensions, is another matter.“It’s profoundly paradoxical,” said Rick Tyler, a longtime Republican strategist who served as communications director for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas during last year’s Republican presidential primary race. “His boss is the most petty person ever to come to Washington.”Barney Frank, the retired longtime Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, marveled at how wholly a sitting government in Washington had embraced a view of Washington villainy.“You expect this from Congress,” not the executive, he said, noting that such open policy fissures within a White House were also something new. “It used to be considered wrong for the opposition party to differ with the president sharply on foreign policy. Now it’s not the opposition party that’s differing from the president on foreign policy, it’s the secretary of state.”In his remarks, Mr. Tillerson was vigilant in treating certain non-“moron” details with due care. He explicitly denied, for instance, that he has ever considered resigning his post, as NBC reported, much less that Vice President Mike Pence had been compelled to persuade him to stay.“One team with one mission,” he said of the Trump executive branch.But few would contest that the relationship between a president and his top employees is a subject of nontrivial global significance. So too, for that matter, is the question of whether the president is a moron. (A State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, later insisted that Mr. Tillerson had not used that language.)The noun at issue on Wednesday is also no novelty in the Trump administration. Gary D. Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, joked to a group of Senate Democrats this year that “only morons pay the estate tax,” according to people present at the meeting.And Mr. Trump himself has let fly the m-word with considerable frequency. His Twitter account has referenced “moron” or some variation thereof more than 50 times since 2012, according to an archive of his handiwork.Some are repurposed comments from little-known users. Some are Trump-branded fusillades at political foes like Karl Rove and George F. Will. Others are Trump-branded fusillades aimed at little-known users.“Why do you follow me like a little puppy, moron?” the future president asked in 2013 of @ninetek, who had assured Mr. Trump, profanely, that no intelligent people cared for his thoughts about sharks.Four years later, the stakes have been elevated some. Mr. Trump has openly undercut his aides as a matter of course, with deliberations that often play out in public view.Mr. Tillerson has appeared uniquely vulnerable to such indignities, eclipsed at times by Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, and even by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was tasked with forging a peace deal in the Middle East. Mr. Tillerson’s policy aims have also been contradicted repeatedly by Mr. Trump.Most recently, when Mr. Tillerson said he was seeking to open lines of communication with North Korea, Mr. Trump told Mr. Tillerson (and some 40 million Twitter followers) that the secretary was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” Mr. Trump’s pejorative nickname for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.Mr. Tyler appraised Mr. Tillerson as “the most abused cabinet member that Trump has,” adding that the competition was considerable.But Mr. Tillerson has exacted a measure of retribution against Mr. Trump, intentionally or not, during his tenure, distancing himself from the president’s equivocal statements about white supremacists after violent demonstrations in August in Charlottesville, Va. “The president speaks for himself,” Mr. Tillerson said then, declining to affirm that Mr. Trump’s words represented “American values.”By the end of Wednesday, whether or not Mr. Tillerson tacitly admitted to calling Mr. Trump a moron, there was at least bipartisan consensus on this much: The stability of a relationship between the president and his secretary of state probably matters.“It’s not helpful to the country to have this kind of thing going on,” said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, who noted that while “there’s pettiness everywhere, in Washington, it’s a blood sport.”“The secretary of state calling the president he or she works for a moron is not a petty point,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. “It’s big news.”Of course, they would say that. They have worked in Washington."
"WASHINGTON — The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee delivered a stark warning on Wednesday to political candidates: Expect Russian operatives to remain active and determined to again try to sow chaos in elections next month and next year.At a rare news conference, Senators Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the committee’s chairman, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and its vice chairman, broadly endorsed the conclusions of American spy agencies that said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a campaign of hacking and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.“The Russian intelligence service is determined — clever — and I recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously,” Mr. Burr said.“You can’t walk away from this and believe that Russia’s not currently active,” he added.American intelligence agencies have concluded that Mr. Putin initially wanted to hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, but later tried to explicitly help Donald J. Trump’s insurgent campaign. The senators said they have reached no conclusion on whether anyone around Mr. Trump was part of that effort.“The issue of collusion is still open,” Mr. Burr said.The news conference was the most extensive since the committee began its investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election early this year and the first time the senators have detailed so fully the trajectory of their secretive investigation and their sense of the stakes. Both men come from swing states where the presidential campaign was fought aggressively.That appeared to have made an impression.“There needs to be a more aggressive whole-of-government approach in terms of protecting our electoral system,” Mr. Warner said. “Remember, to make a change even in a national election doesn’t require penetration into 50 states.”He added, “You could pick two or three states in two or three jurisdictions and alter an election.”The Senate Intelligence Committee is one of three committees on Capitol Hill that have opened full-fledged investigations into the relationship between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. Given the committee’s jurisdiction over the intelligence community and a strong working relationship between Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner, it has been considered the congressional committee most likely to deliver a substantive report on Russia’s covert efforts.Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner sought to inspire confidence on Wednesday that the committee remained on course to do so. They later got a boost from Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he concurred with their statements based on his committee’s work.The senators said that their investigators have pored over nearly 100,000 pages of classified intelligence and documents turned over by the Trump campaign and other associates of the president’s, and they have conducted more than 100 interviews with many of the top officials connected to both the Trump campaign and the intelligence community. Investigators also recently received material from Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Twitter, about advertisements on their platforms linked to Russia.“This feels like it’s taking a long time. It is taking a long time,” Mr. Warner said. “But getting it right and getting all the facts is what we owe the American people.”Mr. Burr had expressed a desire this summer to conclude the inquiry by year’s end. But on Wednesday, he all but conceded that with so many avenues of investigation still open — 25 interviews are scheduled for the remainder of October alone — that would not be possible. While he declined to put a date on the investigation’s conclusion, he said that the committee planned to release portions of its findings before the 2018 midterm election primaries.Still, there were areas of inquiry — and of speculation — that the senators said they felt reasonably confident were benign and could be set aside. They include changes made to the Republican Party platform before last year’s Republican National Convention and vague and unsubstantiated reports of a secret meeting last year at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington between Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador, and Jeff Sessions, then a senator and now the attorney general.In each case, Mr. Burr said the committee had interviewed all of the relevant witnesses and found no evidence of nefarious action.“Campaign staff was attempting to implement what they believed to be guidance to be strong, to be a strong ally on Ukraine, but also leave the door open for better relations with Russia,” Mr. Burr said.Mr. Burr was also unequivocal in saying that the integrity of the vote itself had been preserved, despite Russian attempts to test the vulnerabilities of 21 state election systems.“We can certifiably say that no vote totals were affected,” Mr. Burr said, “that the tallies are accurate.”He also repeatedly steered away from criticizing Mr. Trump, who has questioned the validity of intelligence assessments about the election. Mr. Burr said any questions of criminal acts were best left to the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.In regard to other areas, the senators acknowledged that their work was either stuck or inconclusive. Mr. Burr said they had thus far been unable to get traction on the so-called Steele dossier, a series of memos with sensational claims about Mr. Trump and Russia. The memos’ author, Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, has not agreed to meet with investigators or the senators.“The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who were your sources and sub-sources,” Mr. Burr said. Without Mr. Steele’s input, he continued, the committee had found it “impossible” to rebuild the dossier beyond a certain date.And the committee has only just begun examining more than 3,000 ads turned over on Monday by Facebook. The company said the ads had been purchased by pages and profiles linked to the Internet Research Agency, a secretive company known for spreading Kremlin-linked propaganda, and investigators believe they are part of a highly coordinated disinformation campaign that sought to sow chaos and exploit divisive social issues.The senators said that the committee itself would not release copies of the ads, but welcomed Facebook doing so if it so chooses as investigators continue to work to better understand the extent of the social media campaign.The committee is also waiting for more information from Twitter. The company briefed congressional investigators last week, but Mr. Warner characterized its internal investigation of the issue as derivative and disappointing.Google has started its own internal investigation and plans to cooperate with Congress. All three companies — Facebook, Twitter and Google — have been invited to testify publicly before the committee on Nov. 1.Mr. Warner said he was optimistic that the companies were “recognizing that threat now.” He said Americans and political candidates deserved to know who was funding advertisements and why individual posts were trending."
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will repeal the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s effort to fight climate change, and will ask the public to recommend ways it could be replaced, according to an internal Environmental Protection Agency document.The draft proposal represents the administration’s first substantive step toward rolling back the plan, which was designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, after months of presidential tweets and condemnations of Mr. Obama’s efforts to reduce climate-warming pollution.But it also lays the groundwork for new, presumably weaker, regulations by asking for the public and industry to offer ideas for a replacement.The E.P.A. document, “October 2017 Tiering List,” lays out coming policy issues of high priority for the agency’s office of air and radiation, which oversees air pollution policies.“The agency is issuing a proposal to repeal the rule,” the document states. It says the agency will issue a formal notice of its intention to develop a new rule “similarly intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric utility generating units and to solicit information for the agency to consider in developing such a rule.”The document does not explain how the E.P.A. will justify to the courts the decision to eliminate the regulation. Several industry attorneys familiar with the agency’s plans said they expected Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, to argue that the Obama administration relied on an overly broad reading of federal clean air laws in writing the Clean Power Plan.President Trump has vowed since the campaign to “get rid” of the Obama-era environmental regulations. He has called the Clean Power Plan “stupid” and “job killing,” and in an executive order issued in March he directed Mr. Pruitt to dismantle the rules. Last month, Mr. Trump appeared to claim he had already done so, telling a crowd in Alabama: “Did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone.”Killing the regulation has also been a high priority for Mr. Pruitt, who as attorney general of Oklahoma sued to overturn it in court.But in recent weeks, industry groups have pressed the Trump administration to fashion a new, narrower measure in its stead. Many have argued that creating such a replacement, rather than simply repealing the Clean Power Plan, is necessary to avoid lawsuits. Under a landmark agency determination known as the endangerment finding, the E.P.A. is required to regulate carbon emissions.Mr. Pruitt has been under pressure from interest groups that deny the scientific consensus on climate change — that it is occurring and caused by human emissions — to overturn that determination. The E.P.A. document does not indicate Mr. Pruitt’s plans, but creating a new regulation implicitly accepts that the federal government has a role in addressing the reduction of carbon dioxide.It remains unclear when the agency will formally repeal the rule. Liz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the document or plans for the rule.The Clean Power Plan, which required states to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 32 percent by 2030 relative to 2005 has been tied up in litigation. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had set an Oct. 7 deadline for the E.P.A. to show progress in its decision making.Brian Deese, who served as a senior adviser on climate change to Mr. Obama, said the E.P.A. was buying time. Asking the public for ideas, he said, is what an agency does when it is uncertain about how to proceed. Consideration of a new regulation could take months or even years, he said.“They’re trying to walk this tightrope,” Mr. Deese said."
"WASHINGTON — The explosion from the first mortar round to fall on the C.I.A. annex in Benghazi, Libya, drove shrapnel into the skull of David Ubben, a State Department security agent who had survived an earlier attack on the nearby American Mission and was helping stand watch on a rooftop.Blood gushing down his face, Mr. Ubben dropped to a knee as he heard the whistling of more inbound mortars, he testified Wednesday at the Federal District Court in Washington. Mr. Ubben was crawling to the edge of the roof as the mortars exploded, tearing what he described as a “grapefruit”-size chunk off his arm and all but severing his leg.Mr. Ubben’s testimony about the mortar attack in September 2012 and its aftermath highlighted the third day of the trial of Ahmed Abu Khattala, a Libyan man charged with helping to orchestrate the Benghazi attacks and the first person to stand trial in the case.Defense lawyers for Mr. Khattala — who was captured in 2014 in a Special Operations commando raid in Libya and has been quietly watching the trial while listening to an Arabic translator through headphones — argued that he is being scapegoated.Mr. Ubben offered no evidence linking Mr. Khattala to either attack. In opening statements, the defense team conceded that its client was outside the mission during the attack and later briefly went inside, but said he had gone only out of curiosity, and emphasized that he went home before the mortar attack on the C.I.A. annex.But Julieanne Himelstein, an assistant United States attorney, appeared on Wednesday to be trying to use Mr. Ubben’s testimony to link the two attacks. She asked him questions about maps that the attackers looted from the mission that showed the annex’s location. The suggestion was that the attackers may have used those maps for the mortar attack.On cross-examination, Jeffrey D. Robinson, a lawyer for Mr. Khattala, got Mr. Ubben to acknowledge for the jury that he had no personal knowledge of whether Mr. Khattala masterminded the attacks or used the maps for the mortar attack, and was merely describing what he experienced during the assault.Two Americans — Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and Sean Smith, a State Department computer technician — died of smoke inhalation in a burning building during the initial assault on the diplomatic compound. Two more — Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, C.I.A. security staff members — were killed in the subsequent mortar attack.Mr. Ubben said that he believed Mr. Doherty and Mr. Woods, who were on the roof with him, were shooting at the attackers after the first of three mortar rounds exploded, but their guns fell silent after the second blast, suggesting that it killed them.By then, Mr. Ubben was fighting for his life. He knew he was hurt badly, he said, and believed his leg would probably have to be amputated. With tourniquets on his limbs, he tried to hold on to the neck of a colleague who carried him down a ladder from the roof, then Mr. Ubben lost consciousness.Later, for a winding convoy run to the Benghazi airport, Mr. Ubben, who said he is 6 feet 4 inches tall, was placed on a stretcher and into the back of a small sport utility vehicle. He was too long to fit, he said, so its rear hatch had to be left open, secured with only a strap, and whenever the driver accelerated, Mr. Ubben’s stretcher kept starting to slide out.“I had to put my good leg on the support beam of the car and kind of push back in,” he recounted in an emotionless voice. “So this whole route, I was sliding out of the truck and had to shout to the driver to stomp on the brakes. There was a little bit of comedy.”Mr. Ubben was eventually flown to Germany and then taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, where he spent the next 15 months. He decided to try to save his leg and endured “well over 40 surgeries,” including a major operation to open his skull and repair a brain fluid leak. It took extensive rehabilitation to learn how to use his limbs again, he said, praising the hospital staff for “performing miracles.”Earlier, recounting the immediate aftermath of the mortar attack, he said he recalled being determined to live.“It was extremely painful,” Mr. Ubben said. “But I was committed to surviving. I was going to get out of there. I had made that decision already. I was just working through these things one at a time, trying to get through it.”"
"Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Thursday’s live updates.A familiar pattern often emerges as the authorities investigate a mass shooting: speculation in online forums that one person couldn’t have possibly committed this act alone.Law enforcement officials have stated multiple times that, at this point, they believe that Stephen Paddock, who killed at least 58 and himself and wounded hundreds on Sunday night in Las Vegas, was the only gunman. (Still, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Wednesday that “it was troublesome that he was able to move this much gear into the hotel unassisted.”)Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department explicitly addressed the issue on Monday night: “I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory or that rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock.”Similar rumor mongering has emerged in the wake of previous mass shootings.The morning after a gunman opened fire at a nightclub in Orlando, the police dispelled the rumor that he had accomplices. Some falsely believe the Sandy Hook shooting was staged and seized upon a mysterious “man in the woods” as proof of an additional conspirator. The man was searching for his daughter, a student at the elementary school.In fact, mass shootings have historically been solo acts, with some exceptions like Columbine and San Bernardino.After Sunday’s shooting on an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, several readers have written to The New York Times inquiring about the viral claim that there was a second gunman or additional gunmen.The Times has also seen a handful of unfounded rumors surfacing on social media sites and in search engine queries. These include a Facebook post that claims the shooting was a “false flag,” which has been shared over 350,000 times. A similar report from the conspiracy-focused website Your News Wire has racked up more than 200,000 interactions, according to CrowdTangle, a tool that tracks social media engagement.They both point to a light flashing on a window several floors below the 32nd floor, the location at which law enforcement officials report the gunman was positioned. As Your News Wire breathlessly put it:But that is not the case. In the videos provided, the light and gunshot sounds do not match. And further, footage taken before and after the shooting shows that the light consistently flashed through the night.As Snopes has reported, a video shared on Instagram shows the same light flashing during a performance of “God Bless America” by the country music duo Big and Rich, two hours before the shooting began. Similarly, news footage taken hours after the shooting shows the same light strobing.Some sites have cited activity on the police scanners on the night of the shooting as evidence of additional shooter and/or a broader conspiracy. The site Infowars, which regularly publishes unfounded rumors, even posted one story claiming there was a second shooter while publishing another that included updates debunking the claim.A full listen to the audio of the police scanner during the shooting makes clear that law enforcement officials first made conflicting references to the potential origin of the shots in the beginning of the search:■ One officer reported shots coming from a window on the “50th or 60th floor” on the north side of the Mandalay Bay — an inexact, but close description of the eventually revealed location. Another said he saw “multiple flashes in the middle of Mandalay Bay on north side, kind of on the west tower but toward the center of the casino,” potentially referring to the lower floor light.■ Then one officer reported a more precise location, telling others, “I’m inside the Mandalay Bay on the 31st floor. I can hear the automatic fire coming from one ahead — one floor above us.”■ Another dispelled the notion of a lower floor shooter and said, “I haven’t seen any flashes from Mandalay. But if it is coming from Mandalay, there is a strobe light coming from one of the windows on the east side.”After a few more minutes, the officers pinned down the gunman’s location: “It’s Room 135 on the 32nd floor. I need SWAT.”"
"WASHINGTON — Legislation to rescue the Children’s Health Insurance Program sailed through a Senate committee on Wednesday, but touched off a partisan conflict in the House, diminishing hopes that the popular program would be quickly refinanced.Funding for the program expired on Sunday, and state officials said they would soon start notifying families that children could lose coverage if Congress did not provide additional money. It was impossible to say when Congress might pass a bill and send it to President Trump.By voice vote, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill on Wednesday that would provide more than $100 billion over five years for the program, which insures nearly nine million children.The committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, hailed the bill as “a prime example of what government can accomplish when both parties work together.” Mr. Hatch wrote the bill with the senior Democrat on the committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon, just as Mr. Hatch helped create the program in 1997 with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.But in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, lawmakers brawled Wednesday over a similar bill to provide money for the children’s health program. Democrats strongly support the program, but complained that Republicans would take money from Medicare and the Affordable Care Act to offset the cost.The House committee eventually approved the bill, by a vote of 28 to 23, with all of the opposition coming from Democrats.One provision of the House Republican bill would require older Americans with income of more than $500,000 a year to pay higher Medicare premiums.“Folks that earn a half-million dollars a year and are over 65, they can pay a little bit more for Medicare,” said Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan. “And you know what? If they don’t want to pay, they don’t have to enroll. That’s a choice they will have.”The House bill would also make it easier for states to eliminate Medicaid coverage for some low-income people who hit the jackpot in lotteries. Under current Medicaid rules, income received as a lump sum, such as lottery winnings, is counted as income only in the month when it is received.This forces taxpayers to bear the cost of providing health care benefits for people who no longer need assistance, Republicans said.But Democrats said it was outrageous for Republicans to demand such offsets for CHIP while pushing huge tax cuts that could add hundreds of billions of dollars to federal budget deficits.The Republican CHIP proposals “will likely mean more delay and possibly no action in Congress until the end of the year as part of an omnibus appropriations bill,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee.Time is running short.Minnesota received an emergency infusion of $3.6 million of federal cash on Monday, and Utah has filed an amendment to its CHIP plan that would allow the state to restrict eligibility or benefits if it runs out of cash. Minnesota and two other states are expected to exhaust their CHIP funds by the end of December, and 27 additional states expect to run out of money by March.“People are scared, and they have every right to be,” said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts.Instead of providing money for CHIP, Mr. Kennedy said, “Republicans have focused solely for months on taking health care from millions of Americans” by trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Representative Ryan A. Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he had heard from constituents fearing that children would lose coverage. But in fact, he said, “every child who was eligible for this program as of a week ago is still in that program today.”The Senate bill does not specify how the government would pay for extending the children’s health program. Republicans and Democrats are working together and expect to agree on financing before the bill goes to the Senate floor.High-income Medicare beneficiaries already pay premiums of more than $400 a month. Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the House bill would increase premiums by perhaps $135 a month for people with annual incomes over $500,000.Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said the proposal was “a first step in eroding a social insurance program, Medicare, that has for many years been in the cross-hairs of the Republican Party.” It would, she said, be much better to save money for Medicare by attacking the “price gouging” of some pharmaceutical companies.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, was the only senator who criticized the Senate bill, saying it provided more money than states could reasonably be expected to use — “a number that’s wildly in excess of what anyone thinks could plausibly happen.” Some of the money, he said, will be available as “a slush fund” for activities unrelated to health care for children.“It is completely dishonest budgeting,” Mr. Toomey said. “It is unaccountable. It is meant to circumvent any caps” on spending.But senators of both parties said that Congress could not wait.“If you don’t get this addressed in a timely way, you put children at risk,” Mr. Wyden said. “These enrollment freezes and belt tightening and other emergency measures that states have talked to us about — they are not abstractions. They represent very real problems for kids and parents and families that are walking on an economic tightrope.”"
"WASHINGTON — The federal government learned over the last half-century that it could run up a much larger debt than experts had previously considered prudent or even possible.Now, as Republicans push a tax plan that would propel the federal debt to new heights, experts are debating the lessons of that history. Some see evidence that the downside of deficits is greatly overstated; others say the country just hasn’t reached the precipice.Every dollar of federal borrowing clearly imposes real economic costs, starting with the basic obligation to make regular interest payments, including to foreign investors.But the extent of additional costs is an unresolved question. If deficits are relatively benign, it would strengthen the case for near-term borrowing to increase growth.Federal borrowing has increased sharply. From the mid-1950s until the global financial crisis in 2008, the debt never exceeded half of the nation’s annual economic output. As of June, it stood at around 75 percent of that output. And even without new tax cuts or spending increases, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the debt will reach 106 percent of output over the next two decades, setting a record as an aging population strains federal retirement and health care programs.The amount owed to investors is $14.4 trillion. That’s already a record, but economists prefer to measure the debt in relation to the economy. The United States can afford a larger debt as the economy grows, just as millionaires can afford larger mortgages.As the federal debt rose in the 1980s, and again in the early 2000s, so did the chorus of dire warnings: Inflation and interest rates would rise, economic growth would falter — and, at some point, the markets might simply refuse to finance the federal government over concerns it would be unable to pay its bills.This time around, even those who regard the debt as a real and present danger have become more cautious about the presentation of those arguments. They say policy makers simply can’t know when markets might begin to demand higher rates.“We don’t have a measure of how much fiscal space we have, but a good political metric is to see how far we are from a record-high level of debt,” said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group whose name describes its views.He noted that the debt was on a pace to exceed the high point reached after World War II. “I don’t want to be in the business of testing how far we can go,” he said.The problem confronting those who want the government to reduce annual deficits is that the short-term consequences of profligacy have proved to be very modest, while the political benefits are substantial.“It doesn’t take a political scientist to understand that taking stuff away is a lot less popular than giving stuff out,” Mr. Goldwein said.Low interest rates have greatly reduced the government’s borrowing costs. Measured as a share of the national economy, the federal debt is about three times as large as in the 1960s, but by the same measure, the interest payments are about the same.Interest payments are still projected to total $6 trillion over the next decade. And one thing that has changed: 40 percent of the debt is now held by foreign investors.The impact of federal borrowing on the rest of the economy is harder to assess.Economists warned for decades that deficits caused inflation and reduced the amount of money available to the private sector, ultimately reducing growth and prosperity.The years under President Ronald Reagan suggested that those theories needed some work. As federal deficits ballooned, inflation declined — and all the while the economy grew.“Reagan proved that deficits don’t matter,” Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002, as the George W. Bush administration pursued a similar fiscal policy with roughly the same results.The International Monetary Fund in 2003 published a study of 107 countries over four decades that found little connection between deficits and inflation in developed nations.The economist Robert Mundell had predicted all of this in the early 1970s, offering an alternative to the standard theory that came to be known as supply-side economics.He argued that the government should cut taxes to stimulate the economy, then raise interest rates to attract foreign investment, offsetting the increased federal borrowing.“Suppose it does mean a budget deficit in the United States,” he declared at the 1971 conference where he first presented the proposal. “Who cares?”When he was asked in the 1970s, Mr. Mundell predicted the money would come from the Saudis. In the 1980s, it came from the Japanese. In the 2000s, it came from the Chinese. The one constant has been a sufficient supply of money.Other economists still see evidence that government borrowing weighs on the economy by reducing the money available for investment. This “crowding out” reduces the progress of productivity, which in turn suppresses the growth of incomes — a fairly straight line from more federal debt to less money in the average American wallet.The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2014 that each dollar of debt reduces private-sector investment by somewhere between 15 and 50 cents, after accounting for the role of higher rates in encouraging domestic and foreign investment.As the fear of debt has faded, both parties in recent years have embraced proposals to stimulate the economy at the cost of larger short-term deficits. Democrats have backed increased investment in infrastructure, education and research. Republicans argue that the government should simply leave more money in private hands.Douglas Elmendorf, who led the Congressional Budget Office from 2009 to 2015, repeatedly predicted then that increased federal borrowing would pinch the economy. He said the failure of those predictions suggested there was room to borrow.“The economy has recovered and interest rates have not risen, and that has caused a great deal of reflection and analysis,” said Mr. Elmendorf, who is now the dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. “The widespread conclusion is that interest rates are likely to stay below historical norms for an extended period.”Mr. Elmendorf said the government in the long term still faced a difficult choice of some combination of raising taxes and reducing entitlements. It would be easiest to start soon so those changes can be made gradually. He noted that changes to the Social Security program passed in 1983 are still taking effect 34 years later.In the short term, he said, the government should focus less on increasing overall economic growth than on improving the prospects of lower-income households.Daniel Shaviro, a law professor at New York University, wrote a book called “Do Deficits Matter?” in the mid-1990s, back when most people thought the answer was yes. Today, he said, he worries that people are becoming too confident the answer is no.He said the larger risks were real. If the debt continues to rise, “there’s a pretty good chance that something bad is going to happen at some point,” Mr. Shaviro said. “And you’d rather turn the wheel slowly and gradually rather than stopping abruptly.”"
"The Trump administration on Wednesday walked back the president’s apparent vow to wipe out Puerto Rico’s debt, suggesting that the island would have to solve its own fiscal woes despite the catastrophic damage it has endured from two powerful hurricanes.“I wouldn’t take it word for word with that,” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on CNN in reference to President Trump’s suggestion that the United States might clear Puerto Rico’s debt.Mr. Mulvaney said that the administration would be focusing its efforts on helping Puerto Rico rebuild from storm damage but that the commonwealth would continue to proceed through the debt restructuring process it was undertaking before the storm.“Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out how to fix the errors that it’s made for the last generation on its own finances,” Mr. Mulvaney said.A person with knowledge of the plans to assist Puerto Rico said the president had wanted creditors to grasp the scope of the destruction, and to realize that immediate priorities had to change.The person said that there was now an urgent need for cash on the island, and that Congress could address some of it by loosening the restrictions on programs for housing, health and infrastructure construction that various federal agencies had offered. The funds would be used on the island and not flow through to the creditors, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the debt situation was still being revised.For more than a year, Puerto Rico has clashed with investors who hold slivers of its $73 billion debt, and who have pushed the United States territory to pay up.Confusion over the future of that debt was ignited on Tuesday when Mr. Trump raised the prospect of erasing it.In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump said his administration would help Puerto Rico wipe out the debt to help it recover from the extensive damage left by Hurricane Maria two weeks ago. He did not offer specifics.“We’re going to do something. We’re going to get it back on its feet,” the president said.“We have to look at their whole debt structure,” he told Geraldo Rivera, a Fox News correspondent, on “Hannity.” “You know, they owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street, and we’re going to have to wipe that out. You can say goodbye to that. I don’t know if it’s Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is, you can wave goodbye to that.”If Mr. Trump meant the federal government would work to help Puerto Rico have the debt forgiven, that could result in major losses for investors large and small. Still, it is far from clear whether the president or the federal government has the power to do that. And despite the reference to Goldman Sachs, Puerto Rico’s debt is held by a diverse universe of investors, including big hedge funds and middle-class Puerto Ricans who thought it would make a safe retirement nest egg.Reached late on Tuesday, investors who hold Puerto Rico’s debt and their advisers said they were taken aback and unwilling to comment. One said it was not clear how seriously they should take the remarks, citing promises like Mr. Trump’s so-far-unsuccessful pledge to end the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan passed under President Barack Obama.Most of Puerto Rico’s debt is in the form of municipal bonds, a type of debt governed primarily by state laws — or territorial laws, in Puerto Rico’s case — not by the federal government. Branches of the federal government, like the Internal Revenue Service, can step in under certain circumstances, but not simply to “wipe out” the debt.Puerto Rico’s economy fell into recession in 2006 and has never recovered, and the government resorted to heavy borrowing just to balance its budget. In 2015, the governor announced that its economy had fallen into a death spiral and it would not be able to repay what it owed, but there was little agreement with creditors on what to do next.As a territory, Puerto Rico was not eligible to take shelter in bankruptcy court, and without court protection its creditors began filing lawsuits seeking to enforce their claims. The government came perilously close to running out of cash.Among other things, it used money from its workers’ pension system to pay for operations, leaving a $50 billion hole.Congress enacted a special law, called Promesa, in June 2016 that put Puerto Rico’s finances under a federal oversight board and halted the creditors’ lawsuits. The new law also gave Puerto Rico certain bankruptcy-like powers, like the power to reduce debt unilaterally under the supervision of a federal judge.The federal oversight board has called for a debt moratorium even further reaching than the one Puerto Rico’s governor had sought, in hopes of using the savings to rekindle its shattered economy. Experts thought the recovery would take years, but their projections did not include Hurricane Maria and the collapse of the island’s power grid.In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump praised the “special people” of Puerto Rico but condemned its power grid, which failed during the hurricane, leaving more than three million people without power, communications and in some cases water. Even before the storm, the power authority had been operating under a federal court order for Clean Air Act violations and was reported to have cheated its ratepayers for many years. About $9 billion of Puerto Rico’s total debt was issued by the power authority.“We’re going to get the electric going again,” he said. “You know, that was a complete wipeout. That wasn’t like a couple of poles that came down. That was generating plants. That was a lot of very valuable equipment, but it was equipment in bad shape. But we’re going to put it in good shape.”"
"Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, a strong and frequent critic of abortion, asked a woman with whom he was having an affair to undergo an abortion, according to a report published on Tuesday by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Mr. Murphy, 65, who is married with an adult daughter, confirmed last month that he “became involved in an affair with a personal friend,” according to a statement previously provided to The Post-Gazette.The woman involved in the extramarital affair, Shannon Edwards, told the newspaper last month that her relationship with Mr. Murphy had ended. She said she had gotten to know Mr. Murphy, a Republican, when she volunteered to work on a mental health bill, which was signed into law late last year.In a text message sent to Mr. Murphy on Jan. 25, Ms. Edwards assailed the congressman for hypocrisy. The exchange was included among several documents obtained by The Post-Gazette.“And you have zero issue posting your anti-abortion stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,” Ms. Edwards wrote, according to The Post-Gazette. The newspaper said that the text was sent amid what proved to be an “unfounded pregnancy scare.”According to the newspaper’s report, a text message sent in response from Mr. Murphy’s phone said: “I get what you say about my March for life messages. I’ve never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff don’t write any more. I will.”A spokeswoman for Mr. Murphy said in an email that his office “has no comment or response to” the Post-Gazette article. Mr. Murphy did not respond to phone messages left by The New York Times. Ms. Edwards also did not return a message left on her voice mail.On Tuesday, Mr. Murphy voted for legislation that would make it a crime to perform an abortion after 20 weeks of fetal development, according to The Associated Press. The House of Representatives approved the Republican legislation, according to The A.P.; Mr. Murphy is among its co-sponsors. News roundups on his website also list Mr. Murphy as “a member of the Congressional Pro Life Caucus.”Statements and posts on his verified Facebook page mention his anti-abortion stance.A Facebook post published on Jan. 24 — the day before he received the text message from Ms. Edwards — cast Mr. Murphy as a proud sponsor of a bill that would permanently prohibit the use of federal funds to pay for abortions and prohibit federal medical facilities and health professionals from providing abortion services.In a statement released the same day, he said he hoped that “moving forward, we will once again be a nation committed to honoring life from the moment of conception onward and ensuring American taxpayer dollars are never spent to end a life before it even begins.”Three days later, Mr. Murphy’s office issued another statement saying that he was “proud to join in the March for Life” and that “We must, once again, become a nation respectful of all life.”"
"At least 23 weapons were found in the Las Vegas hotel suite of the gunman who targeted an outdoor concert on Sunday night, killing 59 people, including himself, and injuring more than 500 others. Authorities found 19 more firearms, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, in the home of the gunman, Stephen Paddock.The cache has ignited yet another round of debate over guns and gun control in the United States. Here are some common claims, fact-checked.In response to calls for more gun control and fewer guns, some have pointed to a chart published by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington, to argue that more guns don’t necessarily translate to more gun homicides.The point that more permissive gun laws did not lead to a huge spike in gun violence has merits, said Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. But the chart itself, he said, “is a bunch of hokey.”The chart’s data on the spike in the number of firearms and the decline in the homicides by firearms are accurate. But there is no proof that these two trends are connected. Crime, whether or not committed with guns, has generally declined over the past two decades. Experts aren’t entirely sure why but do say the drop was influenced by a host of economic, racial and demographic factors.“Not a single criminal justice researcher out there looks at the gun homicide rate solely as a function of the number of private firearms,” said Mr. Winkler.A few other statistics quickly puncture the chart’s suggested conclusion.The number of firearms in the United States has steadily increased over the past two decades. It rose to 310 million in 2009, up from 259 million in 2000 and 192 million in 1994.Gun homicides, meanwhile, fell dramatically from a 1993 peak of a rate of 7.02 per 100,000 people; by 1999, it was at 3.82 per 100,000 people. But the homicide rate has remained steady since then, suggesting the correlation between the number of guns and number of gun killings does not hold past the turn of the millennium.At the same time, the number of mass shootings has also spiked dramatically.A flurry of Twitter posts compared spending by the N.R.A. to Planned Parenthood, two groups that are consistently among the nation’s top political contributors.Both groups give vastly less to candidates directly than they invest in outside spending, or expenditures made independent of a candidate often in the form of political advertisements.For example, the N.R.A. — through affiliated groups and individuals — donated $839,215 to candidates in the 2016 campaign cycle, while Planned Parenthood contributed $904,420. But the gun group poured $54 million in outside spending in 2016, more than triple Planned Parenthood’s amount. The N.R.A.’s cumulative spending across three election cycles tops $104 million, more than double than the $41 million spent by Planned Parenthood during the same time, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the campaign finance watchdog.Among the calls for tougher gun restrictions, Hillary Clinton tweeted on Monday to criticize a House bill that would make it easier to purchase gun silencers. “Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the N.R.A. wants to make easier to get,” Mrs. Clinton wrote the day after the massacre in Las Vegas.Addressing other claims that were far more dramatic, The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded three Pinocchios out of four to statements that the gunshot suppressor makes the weapon “quiet.” Mrs. Clinton did not go quite that far.It is not known yet exactly what weapons Mr. Paddock used in the shootings, but a federal law enforcement official said they included AR-15-style rifles.A typical AR-15 produces a decibel level of around 167, “give or take depending on environmental conditions,” according to the Loadout Room, a gear review website. With an average gun suppressor or silencer attached, the rifle’s decibel levels lower to about 136 decibels. Unsilenced, the gun would be louder than a jet engine or fireworks at a very close distance. With a suppressor, it would be as about as loud as jackhammer.Mrs. Clinton has a point that suppressors also make it harder to tell where gunshots are coming from, especially as was the case during the concert in Las Vegas, with its blaring music.Given the many variables involved, it’s extremely difficult — if not impossible — to determine what impact a silencer would have had. But it would not have “silenced” the weapons."
"WASHINGTON — Days before President Trump has to make a critical decision on whether to hold up the Iran nuclear deal, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis openly split with him on abandoning the agreement, the second senior member of the president’s national security team to recently contradict him.Mr. Mattis told senators on Tuesday that it was in America’s interest to stick with the deal, which Mr. Trump has often dismissed as a “disaster.”“Absent indications to the contrary, it is something that the president should consider staying with,” Mr. Mattis told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee after being repeatedly pressed on the issue.The comments were the latest example of how Mr. Trump’s instincts on national security — to threaten North Korea with destruction and tear up an Iran accord that most experts and allies say is working — are running headlong into opposition from his own National Security Council.But rather than keep those arguments inside the White House Situation Room, where similar battles have played out over many presidencies, Mr. Trump’s key advisers are making no secret of their disagreements with their boss.Mr. Mattis came to office with well-established, hawkish views of Iran, whose support of Syria’s government and of Hezbollah, he believed, had cost American lives. But he has always taken the position that if he had to confront Iran, he would rather confront a non-nuclear Iran, and that the agreement was preventing the country from possessing or making enough bomb-grade material for a weapon.Asked on Capitol Hill on Tuesday whether he had changed his view, Mr. Mattis said he supports “the rigorous review that he has got going on right now.”When that answer did not satisfy the committee, Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, asked whether the defense secretary thought holding onto the nuclear pact is in the interest of the national security of the United States.Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, paused before replying: “Yes, senator, I do.”An administration official said that no difference existed between the president’s views and those of his secretary of defense on the Iran deal.But the evident dissonance between the president and his senior national security advisers has taken on greater consequence in the cases of Iran and North Korea, which are potentially questions of war or peace.Amid the simmering North Korean crisis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters  in Beijing over the weekend that he was keeping “a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang” to defuse the situation. The next morning, he was slapped down by Mr. Trump, who read newspaper accounts of that conversation and tweeted “save your energy Rex,” complaining that Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” the president’s derisive nickname for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.White House officials said Mr. Trump was angry that his secretary of state was suggesting it was time to talk with North Korea, when official administration policy is that the North must earn the right — by halting missile and nuclear tests for an unspecified period of time.It was hardly the first time that Mr. Tillerson, who is widely reported to be frustrated in the job, has publicly split with the president. In August, he conceded that he had argued in favor of keeping the Iran deal, saying he had “differences of views” from the president. At the same time, he acknowledged that Iran continued to support terrorism and was failing to comply with what he called “the spirit” of the agreement.At the meeting with reporters in the American ambassador’s residence in Beijing, Mr. Tillerson hinted he was pressing Mr. Trump to certify to Congress once again that Iran is in compliance with the agreement despite Mr. Trump’s declaration in August that he would have declared the country “noncompliant 180 days ago.”Mr. Trump must make that decision anew by Oct. 15. But his choice is not necessarily the final word on the deal. Even if he decertifies the agreement, Congress could hold back on restoring the economic sanctions that the United States agreed to ease in exchange for Iran halting its nuclear weapons program. If Congress did not act, the deal would be preserved.“I don’t want to suggest to you that we’re not going to stick with the Iranian deal,” Mr. Tillerson said. “The president will have to make that decision; ultimately, it’s what he wants to do.”Mr. Mattis told lawmakers on Tuesday that Tillerson was “probing opportunities to talk” with North Korea and sidestepped questions about the president’s tweets about his secretary of state.And at his confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Mattis described the Iran deal as flawed but said the United States should remain committed to it, and to working with the other nations that negotiated it: Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. “I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement — it’s not a friendship treaty,” Mr. Mattis said at the time. “But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.”In the first eight months of the Trump administration, Mr. Mattis has made a habit of navigating Trump’s bombast with measured — often seemingly contradictory — statements. He has warned about the potential for huge loss of life if the Korean crisis ended up resuming the war that ended in an armistice in 1953. Taken by surprise by the president’s tweet declaring a ban on transgender members of the military, he quietly got wording into the final executive order that gave him time to delay, or upend, the ban.Inside the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., have told aides they are worried that abandoning the Iran deal could make it harder to convince North Korea that the United States would stick with any diplomatic agreement it might be able to reach to head off — or at least pause — the growing confrontation.General Dunford testified at the same hearing alongside Mr. Mattis, and while he did not take a position on the Iran deal, his description about whether Tehran is violating the accord was at odds with the administration’s talking points. He said Iran “is not in material breach” of the agreement and that it had “delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran.”White House officials, by contrast, have said that Iran was violating hortatory language in the agreement about fostering better relations, even if it is not reprocessing plutonium and enriching uranium, the two pathways to a bomb.Diplomacy Works, an Iran deal advocacy group run by former Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who negotiated the accord, lauded Mr. Mattis’s support for the pact.“The president’s most senior security adviser now joins the likes of the United States’ closest allies and the International Atomic Energy Association in confirming that the Iran nuclear deal is not only working, and that Iran is in compliance, but that it remains the best agreement to protect American interests,” the group said in a statement.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened to tear up the deal, and negotiate a better one. In August, Mr. Trump also said that Iran is “not in compliance with the agreement and they certainly are not in the spirit of the agreement in compliance.”"
"WASHINGTON — David Ubben, disoriented and bleeding, was crawling through a burning building at the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya, when he stumbled across the lifeless body of Sean Smith.Mr. Ubben, a State Department security agent who testified Tuesday at the United States District Court in Washington, dragged Mr. Smith, a computer technician, out of the building, then returned to look for Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. But when a frantic Libyan guard implored him and other Americans to leave before the attackers returned, Mr. Ubben reluctantly agreed to call off the search.“I didn’t like the idea of not recovering at least his body,” he told the court. “I realized that the chances of finding him alive were very slim at this point, especially after we had recovered Sean Smith. Nevertheless, I wanted to at least recover his body.”Mr. Ubben’s testimony capped the second day of the trial of Ahmed Abu Khattala, a Libyan man whom prosecutors have accused of helping orchestrate the September 2012 attacks on the American Mission and a nearby Central Intelligence Agency annex. Mr. Khattala’s defense lawyers have argued that he is being scapegoated for the actions of other people.Neither Mr. Ubben nor two other witnesses who took the stand on Tuesday — including Scott Wickland, another diplomatic security agent who survived the attack, who had started testifying on Monday — mentioned Mr. Khattala. Prosecutors have said that they intend to establish the events of the night of the attack first, then turn to Mr. Khattala’s alleged role.The government supplemented the second day of testimony with clips of surveillance videos from the attacks, including footage of Mr. Ubben and two other agents as they emerged from a villa, each wearing body armor and brandishing rifles, and prepared to drive an armored vehicle to the burning building.Mr. Wickland had left off on Monday afternoon after testifying about losing contact with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Smith inside the smoke-filled building, returning several times to search for them and eventually taking refuge on the roof.On Tuesday morning, Mr. Wickland picked up from that point, describing how colleagues — including Mr. Ubben — had arrived at the building to rescue him, found Mr. Smith’s body and decided it was not safe to stay any longer, so they left for the C.I.A. annex.Despite his exhaustion and the difficulty he was having breathing because of smoke inhalation, Mr. Wickland said, he took the wheel of an armored vehicle and tried to dodge attackers who threw a bomb at it and sprayed it with bullets.Mr. Ubben, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, later recounted a “surreal” moment during that attack in which he locked eyes with one of the attackers.“I remember him very clearly,” Mr. Ubben said. “He had a red soccer jersey on and he had an AK-47 in his hands. We had this kind of odd moment and stared at each other — it must have been just a second — and then he lifted his weapon and started firing on the vehicles.”The rounds, Mr. Ubben said, struck the bulletproof glass next to his face.Mr. Wickland said he plowed through a roadblock set up by militants, then careened down another street, straddling a median to avoid traffic.After they reached the C.I.A. annex, Mr. Ubben climbed to a roof, where he had several calls, he said, including calling his wife to let her know that there had been an attack but that he had survived. He also received a call from a Libyan government official, whom he refused to tell where they had gone.Mr. Ubben also received a call, he said, from a contact at a Libyan militia that had been hired to provide security for the mission but had seemingly done nothing during the attack. The man had not responded to calls when the attack started, but said his group had killed numerous attackers, Mr. Ubben said. Mr. Ubben did not believe him.Mr. Ubben’s testimony ended there on Tuesday; he is expected to pick up on Wednesday.Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Wickland had recounted what happened next: Mortars began to fall on the roof, killing two C.I.A. operatives, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, and gravely wounding two other men — including Mr. Ubben.“Dave, the mortar had basically ripped off his leg. He had shrapnel in his face. It had ripped off part of his arm,” Mr. Wickland testified, describing putting tourniquets on his friend and trying to encourage him. “I didn’t think Dave was going to live.”But on Tuesday, Mr. Ubben was able to walk to the witness stand."
"WASHINGTON — Amid a nationwide surge in immigration arrests spearheaded by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court weighed on Tuesday whether immigrants facing deportation are entitled to have their detentions, which can stretch for years, reviewed by a judge.The justices were considering whether immigrants fighting deportation or applying for asylum in the United States are entitled to periodic hearings before a judge to decide whether they can be released on bond while their cases make their way through the nation’s clogged immigration courts.Lawyers for the immigrants argue that the government’s practice of keeping immigrants in jail-like detention facilities indefinitely, without independent reviews of whether there are grounds for keeping them there, violates their due process rights.It was the second time the justices had heard arguments in the case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204. The case was first presented to the court last year without receiving a decision, requiring a rehearing before the full nine-member court that now includes Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. The court presumably deadlocked 4 to 4 last year, so Justice Gorsuch is likely to cast the deciding vote.Some justices seemed sympathetic to the immigrants’ plight. “No neutral magistrate of any kind is looking at the decision to make sure it’s not arbitrary,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. “Someone should be looking at it.”But many justices seemed interested in unraveling whether a six-month deadline for a bond hearing a lower court had mandated was the right answer, or whether individualized hearings based on a variety of factors were preferable. Even if it seemed reasonable for a judge to review an immigrant’s detention, several justices suggested, why was six months the magic number?“Where does it say six months in the Constitution?” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked. “Why isn’t it seven? Why isn’t it eight?”The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ruled that immigrants are entitled to a bond hearing every six months and that the government must show that the immigrant poses a flight risk or a danger to the community to justify extending the detention. But the government — first the Obama administration, and now the Trump administration — has strongly opposed imposing any such one-size-fits-all deadline, and appealed the appeals court’s decision to the Supreme Court. It has argued that immigrants can file individual habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detentions.Several of the more liberal-leaning justices seemed deeply skeptical of the idea that immigrants, even those who had just shown up at the border to ask for asylum and had no community ties to the United States, would be afforded no protections against arbitrary detention.“I’m pretty nervous about that,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. He asked why immigrants could not expect to have their detentions reviewed by a judge, “particularly when,” he said, “we give triple ax murderers” such hearings.Justice Gorsuch, meanwhile, quizzed the lawyer representing the immigrants seeking the bond hearings, Ahilan T. Arulanantham, of the American Civil Liberties Union, about what would happen under the six-month standard if an immigrant wanted to challenge his or her detention before the six-month mark or at some point after being detained more than six months but less than a year.Mr. Arulanantham said imposing a six-month deadline made the standard easier to administer and ensured that immigrants who lacked the legal knowledge or resources to file their own habeas petitions would get a hearing.As a practical matter, Mr. Arulanantham said, though individuals might file habeas petitions before the six-month mark, the courts move so slowly that there is little chance the petitions would be resolved until much later.“When detention becomes prolonged, you have to draw the line somewhere,” he said.He acknowledged that 90 percent of detention cases were resolved within six months, with the immigrant either deported or released, but emphasized that thousands of people remained in limbo beyond that mark.Several of the more conservative justices seemed to accept the government’s contention that some immigrants might stay in detention longer than they otherwise would because they were contesting their deportation cases.“It’s really the alien’s choice to trigger further delay,” said Malcolm L. Stewart, a deputy solicitor general representing the government in the case.In a previous case, in 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that immigrants facing deportation may “be detained for the brief period” required to resolve their cases. The Justice Department had told the court that the average time that one set of immigrants was detained was about four months. In August, however, the government told the court the earlier data had been wrong; in fact, the average detention lasted more than a year.At the moment, many immigrants are detained for long periods without the ability to ask for hearings. When some receive hearings, a substantial number may win release: According to A.C.L.U. data, of the 1,680 bond hearings held in the Los Angeles area between October 2012 and April 2014 under the six-month rule imposed by the Ninth Circuit, immigration judges granted release in 70 percent of the cases.Lawyers for the immigrants seeking hearings also argue that those held in detention often go on to win their deportation cases or to earn asylum."
"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders are backing away from a proposal to fully repeal an expensive tax break used by more than 40 million tax filers to deduct state and local taxes amid pushback from fellow lawmakers whose residents rely on the popular provision.The state and local tax deduction is estimated to cost $1.3 trillion over the next decade and its repeal is central to paying for a sweeping tax rewrite unveiled last week by Republican lawmakers and administration officials. But elimination of the provision has emerged as a flash point in the nascent debate over the plan, with Republicans in high-tax states worried about backlash from residents who could see their tax bills rise.The White House and Republican lawmakers are considering alternatives to an outright repeal, including allowing taxpayers to choose between deducting their mortgage interest or state and local taxes, a limit on the deduction or a special tax break for middle-class families that live in areas with high property taxes.Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, said in an interview on Tuesday that party leaders had assured him “there’s not going to be full repeal” of the state and local tax deduction. Mr. Collins, who represents a district in upstate New York, is among the more than 30 Republicans whose residents make heavy use of the deduction and would be more likely to see their tax bills rise if the provision is eliminated.Mr. Collins said he raised concerns about the proposed repeal at a dinner on Monday with Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, who leads the Ways and Means Committee, and again at lunch on Tuesday with Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, the House majority leader.He said both Mr. Brady and Mr. McCarthy acknowledged that full repeal would be a “nonstarter” with a large bloc of Republicans in the conference, and that “it’s safe to say, we’re no longer going to be talking about a full repeal.”A spokeswoman for Mr. Brady confirmed the state and local deduction was discussed over the Monday dinner but did not elaborate. She referred reporters to Mr. Brady’s comments on Monday, when he told a press gathering that party leaders were still crafting the details of their plan, and “listening very closely to all our lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, who are in high-tax states.”Preserving the deduction entirely would raise the cost of the Republican tax plan by more than $1 trillion over 10 years and an additional $2.3 trillion over the following decade, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. The analysis has not calculated for alternate scenarios, such as higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans, but anything less than a full repeal would mean less money for federal coffers and could make it more difficult for Republicans to slash corporate tax rates as low as they are proposing.Mr. Collins said one possibility under discussion would be forcing taxpayers to choose between claiming a deduction for mortgage interest or for property taxes, but not both, on property valued up to $1 million.The state and local tax deduction has its fair share of critics, including conservative lawmakers who argue it is an unfair federal subsidy of wealthier states with high taxes. They also argue that it tends to benefit wealthy taxpayers who itemize deductions on their tax returns.Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, suggested that as a compromise, the deduction for state and local taxes could be retained but capped at a certain amount, in order to provide “a fair deduction but not one that is disproportionately enjoyed by people in New York or New Jersey.”“That way, North Carolina would be on parity with other states,” he said.Even lawmakers who want to kill the state and local tax deduction have acknowledged that it may survive.“I think the administration is thinking about some minor sort of real estate tax break for those middle-class families in high real estate tax jurisdictions,” said Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.Mr. Cassidy lamented that fate, saying it is unfair for residents of Louisiana to subsidize wealthy taxpayers in California who write off the state’s high taxes.The White House does not appear to be craving a fight over the provision. Last week, Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, signaled that President Trump would be willing to negotiate on the state and local tax deduction. While he is committed to getting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, Mr. Cohn said that the deduction was not a “red line.”The framework called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, creating a new lower 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses and doubling the standard deduction. It would also eliminate many other deductions and loopholes. The preliminary estimate of the cost of the overall plan by the Tax Policy Center was $2.4 trillion over 10 years.Bruised by criticism that their tax plan could prove costly to many middle-class Americans, Republican leaders in Congress have assailed the study as inaccurate and they continued to lash out at it on Tuesday.Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, described it as “haphazardly cobbled together” on the grounds that the tax framework was still missing so many important details that would affect its cost and impact, such as how much the child tax credit might increase and which business deductions might be repealed.Asked if preserving the state and local deduction was one of the details he was willing to change, Mr. Hatch responded affirmatively.“I’m open to everything,” he said."
"WASHINGTON — Federal officials on Monday approved a $3.6 million emergency infusion for Minnesota after the state’s human services chief warned that pregnant women and some children were at imminent risk of losing health care coverage under the Children’s Health Insurance Program.Utah, meantime, has formally requested authority to “eliminate eligibility and services under CHIP” if the state does not have enough money to continue coverage.In statehouses around the country, officials are preparing for the worst as lawmakers in Washington struggle to find money for the popular Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures nearly nine million children but lost its spending authority on Sunday, with the start of the new fiscal year.Congress has known for two years that federal funds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program were expiring this fall. But only on Wednesday are two congressional panels — the Senate Finance Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee — tentatively scheduled to vote on legislation that would provide money for the program for another five years.And the two chambers have not agreed on how to pay for the measures.“We know that there is a desire in Congress to provide the funds, but we have heard that same sentiment all through the spring and the summer,” said Nathan Checketts, the deputy director of the Utah Health Department. “Congress needs to get this done as soon as possible, so states do not have to begin notifying people that their coverage may end.”The Utah program covers 19,000 children.Most states still have unspent funds that will last several months. But some are drafting contingency plans in case Congress does what it has done so often: fails to reach an agreement. A federal panel that advises Congress on the Children’s Health Insurance Program says that more than half the states are expected to exhaust all their CHIP funds within six months.By the end of this year, Arizona, Minnesota and North Carolina are likely to run out of money for their programs, according to the panel, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission.By March 2018, it said, CHIP funds will be exhausted in 27 additional states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Another 19 states are expected to use up their money from April to June 2018, with one state exhausting its funds from July to September 2018.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, said Tuesday that Congress’s failure to act jeopardized coverage for 330,000 children in the state.Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, said the need was “not dire or urgent.” Republicans, he said, intend to provide the funds, so “the money that is necessary to keep this program going is not in jeopardy.”But Democrats accused Republicans of willful inattention.“If making sure that every child in America has access to health care, if that is not a priority, what is?” asked Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. “Families are waiting anxiously while their health security is hanging in the balance.”Action in the Senate was delayed for several weeks as Republicans made repeated unsuccessful attempts, in July and September, to pass legislation that would have repealed much of the Affordable Care Act.CHIP is for children in families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford other coverage. Nearly 90 percent of children in the program had family incomes less than twice the poverty level (less than about $40,000 a year for a family of three).Even if congressional committees can agree, it is not clear how soon legislation will emerge from Congress. The Senate plans to be in recess next week, and the House is expected to be in recess in the following week.The Senate bill is a bipartisan measure, drafted by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. Mr. Hatch, now the chairman of the Finance Committee, helped create the child health program in 1997 and says he is eager to extend it.In the House, some Democrats have expressed concerns about the bill drafted by House Republicans because, they say, it would pay for continuation of the CHIP program by cutting other health spending. Some House Democrats have suggested offsets that would instead reduce payments to pharmaceutical companies.Under federal law, states receive annual allotments of federal CHIP funds. They have two years to spend their allotments, and unspent money is then available for redistribution to other states. The money sent to Minnesota this week came from that pool of unspent funds.The Senate and House bills would each provide a total of $118.5 billion over five years, but under arcane budget rules, Congress needs to offset less than 10 percent of that cost. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that if the program ended, some children would become uninsured, but the federal government would help provide coverage for others, through Medicaid or through private insurance subsidized under the Affordable Care Act.The federal government and the states have historically shared the cost of CHIP, with Washington paying approximately 70 percent of the cost in a typical state. The Affordable Care Act increased the federal share by 23 percentage points, with the result that the federal government has been paying the entire cost in 11 states.The Senate and House bills would continue the 23 percentage point bonus in 2018 and 2019, cut it in half in 2020 and eliminate it in 2021 and 2022."
"Health insurers are aggressively increasing prices next year for individual policies sold under the federal health care law, with some raising premiums by more than 50 percent.By approving such steep increases for 2018 in recent weeks, regulators in many states appeared to be coaxing companies to hang in there, despite turmoil in the market and continuing uncertainty in Congress about the future of the law, the Affordable Care Act.In Georgia, the state insurance commissioner, Ralph T. Hudgens, an outspoken critic of the law, often referred to as Obamacare, said the rates he approved would be up to 57.5 percent higher next year. The state had already lost Anthem, the large insurer that offers for-profit Blue Cross plans in several states, which left many markets in Georgia.“Obamacare has become even more unaffordable for Georgia’s middle class,” Mr. Hudgens said in a statement. “I am disappointed by reports that the latest Obamacare repeal has stalled once again and urge Congress to take action to end this failed health insurance experiment.”In Florida, the average rate increase will be about 45 percent, according to state regulators. And in New York, where officials said prices would still be below where they were before the law took effect, premiums were expected to increase by an average of about 14 percent. Many states have not made insurers’ rate increases public, and experts said the rise in costs for consumers could run from 10 percent to nearly 60 percent.There are exceptions. Minnesota, which sought a federal waiver to address the high cost of premiums, said this week that prices for plans sold on the state exchange there would remain stable or drop significantly in 2018.Those who qualify for federal subsidies, a group that accounts for about 85 percent of the roughly 10 million people who buy insurance through the marketplaces created under the health law, will largely be shielded from the higher prices.Regulators in Florida and New York said that residents of those states who qualified for the most generous subsidies could see lower prices next year, depending on which plan they buy. In some places, the least expensive plans could become free after customers apply their subsidies. (Deficit hawks will probably complain about the higher federal outlays for subsidies.)People who earn too much to qualify for financial assistance will feel the brunt of any increases. Because many insurers raised prices most sharply on plans that are attractive to people who receive the most generous subsidies, those unable to get subsidies may have to shop for plans that are not affected or look beyond their state marketplaces for lower-priced options.The final prices and policies available for all plans may not be public until Nov. 1, leaving many consumers confused about coverage costs as a shortened period of open enrollment for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act begins.The insurance companies have defended the rate increases, saying they were unavoidable under the current circumstances. After the latest Senate effort to repeal the health law collapsed, insurers still have no commitment about whether the government will continue to allocate millions of dollars in critical financing. Some lawmakers have renewed talk of a bipartisan solution to guarantee that the money keeps flowing, but there is no resolution — forcing insurers to set rates without an agreement.The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether it will enforce key elements of the law like the individual mandate, which encourages healthy people to sign up for insurance or be charged a tax penalty. If insurers cannot spread out the cost of coverage for people with high medical bills over a large enough group, they may be inclined to raise premiums even higher.“We’re all pricing up for it,” said Dr. Martin Hickey, the chief executive of New Mexico Health Connections, one of the few remaining insurance start-ups created by the federal law. New Mexico Health Connections recently expanded an existing partnership with Evolent Health, a public company, which will provide additional capital.In New Mexico, the average rate increase for plans sold on the state marketplace is about 30 percent. “Half of that increase is due to the uncertainty in Washington and the inability to lead,” said John G. Franchini, the state insurance regulator. The four insurers selling policies in the state marketplace are offering more types of plans.After a slow start, many insurers have been making money in the individual market for the past year or so. Premiums have generally risen faster than underlying medical expenses, according to a recent analysis by the research firm Mark Farrah Associates. With rates set to climb much higher next year, insurers could see profits rise significantly too.But questions about the insurance market’s future make it nearly impossible to come up with accurate projections. Regulators and actuaries said that the higher rates reflected a conservative approach as a cushion against potentially sizable losses.“It’s very hard for a regulator to deny those rate increases when we can take a look at their bottom line and can tell they can’t continue if they can’t keep their head above water,” said Mike Kreidler, Washington State’s insurance commissioner and a supporter of the health law.Actuaries said that the higher rates were justified. The insurers “are really struggling,” said Kurt Giesa, a partner with Oliver Wyman, a consultant that has worked with regulators to review rates. “They have been working hard to adapt to what they are faced with right now,” he said.And although they have been raising prices aggressively, “it doesn’t mean that insurers couldn’t lose money,” said Deep Banerjee, an industry analyst for Standard & Poor’s who has been following the improved profitability of Blue Cross plans. “The trend has been improving but the market is still fragile,” he said.The uncertainty over paying insurers for the so-called cost-sharing reductions, which limit out-of-pocket medical costs for people with low incomes, remains problematic. Most state regulators let insurers set prices to cover the cost of the required reductions, but several did not.The Trump administration has been paying insurers on a month-to-month basis; a legal challenge over the payments by House Republicans has left the issue in limbo.In the states that did not allow insurers to account for a loss of federal funding, the rates would be “inadequate” if that funding went away, said David M. Dillon, a fellow with the Society of Actuaries who has also worked with several state regulators. They “are just hopeful that something can be fixed later on,” he said.Two insurers pulled out of the markets at the last minute because of the confusion. Medica stopped offering coverage in North Dakota next year because regulators said insurers had to assume the financing would continue; Anthem abandoned the Maine marketplace because the money had not been guaranteed.Mr. Kreidler of Washington approved two sets of rates but is only allowing insurers to charge the lower set. If the government stops paying for the subsidies, he said, “It’s going to be a real challenge.”If Congress or the administration decide to keep providing the subsidies, prices will be higher than necessary if insurers raised their rates to make up for a loss of the funding. “We’ll see if we can lower those rates with the permission” of the federal agency responsible for overseeing the marketplace, Mr. Franchini of New Mexico said.Some insurers think a decision on the cost-sharing money could come too late.CareFirst, a Blue Cross insurer, offers plans in Virginia and Maryland. Virginia allowed CareFirst to assume a lack of financing; Maryland regulators prohibited insurers from setting higher rates based on a loss of subsidies.“You have this unbelievable contradiction,” said Chet Burrell, CareFirst’s chief executive. In Maryland, where the company is losing money on individual policies, it could sustain much deeper losses if the federal money stopped coming in.“I don’t think you can work it out,” he said. “The workout is you will have to eat it this year.”Like other insurance executives, Mr. Burrell worries that the higher prices will eventually discourage too many healthy people from enrolling. In Maryland, he said, only one-third of those buying coverage are eligible for subsidies. Everyone else pays full price. The most popular type of plan could come with premiums of $373 a month to $686 a month for a 40-year-old.“Given the size of the rate increases, we think healthier people will continue to opt out of the risk pool,” he said, suggesting that would lead to rates being even higher in 2019. “If that occurs, then you’re in a death spiral,” he said, because as rates climb, more healthy people drop out, sending prices even higher. Mr. Burrell said he was working with regulators in Maryland to potentially create a fund that would help care for patients with the very high medical bills while possibly lowering overall premiums.But even insurers in states that have allowed for the loss of funding are not sanguine.“I think it’s going to be a stumbling in the dark next year because of all the uncertainties,” Dr. Hickey of New Mexico Health Connections said. The changing circumstances and inaction by Congress have forced insurers to raise rates and experiment with different plans for those who are not eligible for federal assistance.“It’s almost like the beginning, again,” he said."
"WASHINGTON — Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, was at a loss on Tuesday. After the massacre of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, he challenged the pro-gun bent of his state and co-authored legislation to expand background checks of gun purchasers, only to see the measure fail.“I just think that common sense has to prevail,” a dispirited Mr. Manchin said, explaining why he thinks that now is “the wrong time” to revive his bill. “But until that happens, until other people feel the same, we’re at a stalemate and that’s a shame.”For years, amid a string of mass shootings in places whose names are by now seared into the national psyche — Columbine, Aurora, Virginia Tech, Newtown, San Bernardino, Orlando and now Las Vegas — Democrats have tried to enact what they call “common-sense” gun restrictions. Time and time again, they have failed.This week’s massacre in Las Vegas, which killed at least 59 people and injured more than 500, appears to have done little to change Washington’s gun control dynamic.As they have done in the past, Democrats are contemplating legislation shaped to the massacre; Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested targeting kits that could legally transform semiautomatic weapons to automatic ones. The Las Vegas gunman apparently used so-called bump stocks — legal modifications to semiautomatic rifles — to help them fire more like automatic weapons.“This is the least we should do in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history,” Ms. Feinstein said. “It should be our highest priority.”That tactic mirrored the Democrats’ tailored approaches of the past: After the Newtown shooting, they called for background checks for all gun purchases, including those at gun shows and from online sellers. After the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., last year, they tried to ban gun sales to people on federal no-fly or terrorism watch lists. After the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, it was improving background checks to catch mental illness.And as they have done in the past, Republicans tried to steered the conversation in another direction, this time spotlighting the work of emergency medical workers. President Trump praised the swiftness of the Las Vegas law enforcement response, calling it “in many ways, a miracle.”In the Capitol, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, rebuffed questions about potential legislative action during his regular news conference Tuesday afternoon, saying that he thought it “particularly inappropriate” to politicize the massacre so soon. Republicans, he said, would instead remain focused on advancing a tax overhaul.“Look, the investigation’s not even been completed,” Mr. McConnell said. “And I think’s it’s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any.”Indeed, the only gun legislation on the Republicans’ agenda appears to be the so-called Hearing Protection Act — a gun rights measure that would eliminate a $200 tax on firearm silencers, refund silencer-tax payments back to October of 2015, and ease registration requirements.That measure has been working its way through the House, though Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Tuesday that he has no plans at the moment to bring it up for a vote. House Democratic leaders have called for Mr. Ryan to withdraw the gun silencers bill, and to create a special committee to investigate gun violence in America, which would report back with legislative solutions.“We are stuck,” said Representative Linda T. Sánchez of California, the vice chairwoman of the House Democratic caucus. “We have asked time and time again of our Republican counterparts to please engage in this discussion of how do we stop gun violence, and they are completely unwilling to do anything to help us out on that issue.”Congress is, in fact, not completely stuck — even on difficult issues framed in terms of life and death. House Republicans on Tuesday took up legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The House just passed legislation 237-189.The contrasting action and inaction — on abortion and gun control — spotlighted the stark politics of “life” in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting. As they debated the abortion bill, members of both parties juxtaposed the two issues.Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who was at a congressional baseball practice in June when a gunman opened fire, nearly killing a senior Republican, said that the gun issue was “separate” from the abortion debate.But Republicans who praised emergency medical workers in Las Vegas also repurposed that praise in the abortion debate. “These are little boys and little girls waiting to be born,” said Representative Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, in a speech in the House defending the abortion ban. “If we do not stand for them, who will stand for them? If we are not the first responders, who will be the first responders?”Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, was incredulous.“There is this absolute silence on the deaths that have been created through guns and irresponsible gun ownership and yet here we are somehow talking about the sanctity of life when it relates to abortions,” she said.Representative Louise Slaughter, a Democrat of New York, put in bluntly. “I don’t know anything else to call it but pure hypocrisy,” she said. “We love it until it’s born and then it’s somebody else’s problem.”So far, Republicans in the House have shown no interest in any additional legislation that would limit guns. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third-ranking House Republican nearly killed by a gunman in June, reappeared Tuesday at a House Republican leadership news conference. He said nothing about gun legislation.In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Scalise said that what he saw in Las Vegas “fortified” his stance in support of the Second Amendment.Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, did tell an NBC News reporter that lawmakers “ought to take a look at” conversion kits that can make guns more lethal. But Mr. Thune also suggested little could be achieved through legislation.“I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions,” he said. “To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said — get small.”Some gun safety advocates acknowledged that expanding background checks would not have prevented the massacre in Las Vegas. Among them was Lori Hankey Haas, whose daughter was wounded in the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007.“Is there a single policy that would have prevented this particular mass shooting?” asked Ms. Haas, who is now the Virginia state director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, an advocacy group. “I doubt it seriously. But it doesn’t mean you don’t try.”"
"Nine weeks ago, Anthony Scaramucci was still the communications director to the president, flying on Air Force One and steering the public relations strategy of the White House.On Monday evening, he was a man with his arm in a sling, explaining how the moon landing led to the invention of Tang and Velcro (it didn’t) to reporters in the mirrored basement of a Midtown Manhattan steakhouse that he partially owns.The arc of Mr. Scaramucci’s career is long and strange, and lately it has bent toward ignominy. After being fired by President Trump, sued for divorce and turned into a late-night piñata for his foul-mouthed speaking habits, Mr. Scaramucci is trying to mount a comeback with a media venture he is calling The Scaramucci Post.So far, the project’s contours are vague. “It’s going to start out experiential on the net,” Mr. Scaramucci, an American flag pinned to his lapel, said during a launch party at the Hunt & Fish Club on West 44th Street.He was invited to elaborate.“We’re going to create traffic and content and an experience using Facebook, Instagram and Twitter,” Mr. Scaramucci said. (The @ScaramucciPost Twitter account, with its caveat that “Follows ≠ Job Offers,” has been something of a mystery in political circles.)The publication is so devoted to its social media strategy that it has no journalists, no articles and no website — apparently by design. “You’ll find that if you don’t have a website, guess what? You don’t have any server charges,” Mr. Scaramucci said.Later, he conceded that he had “no idea what the Scaramucci Post is.”His partner in the venture, a former hedge fund manager turned social media consultant named Lance Laifer, stood nearby, urging Mr. Scaramucci to speak into an iPhone that was transmitting the proceedings via streaming video.Mr. Laifer, a friend of Mr. Scaramucci for years, founded Old Forge Media Management and is probably best known as the man who persuaded the actor Taye Diggs to follow tens of thousands of people on Twitter. He said the idea for the Scaramucci Post was hatched during a 1 a.m. phone call while he was visiting Disney World with his family. “What I think we can do here is take people and get them to work together to make the world a better place,” Mr. Laifer said.“There’s a wide open space in the middle that’s not being served the way it was served when I was a kid,” Mr. Scaramucci added. “It’s the Walter Cronkite space, the space in the middle where there’s a level of objectivity.”Guests at the party, held beneath a mirrored ceiling dotted with festive red lights, included a number of Scaramucci supporters, among them employees of his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital. A buffet featured giant popovers and penne mushroom ragu. Mr. Scaramucci wore a sling, the result of a recent shoulder injury, which he attributed to horseplay with one of his children on the basketball court.Long a minor celebrity on Wall Street, Mr. Scaramucci came to prominence as the silver-tongued Trump confrere whose brief run at the White House culminated in an expletive-laced tirade to a New Yorker correspondent. Recently, he hired a Hollywood publicist and has appeared on TMZ, “The View,” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”On Monday, he announced that the Scaramucci Post has signed its first advertiser: the Knockout Times, a website about female athletes started by a woman named Jamie Lewis who said she knew Mr. Scaramucci from her time working on Wall Street. “We’re trying to bring a voice to strong female women, specifically related to athletics,” Ms. Lewis said.One reporter began a question by noting that Mr. Scaramucci’s White House tenure had lasted only 10 days. The host interrupted.“Hey,” Mr. Scaramucci said, a glint in his eye. “Eleven days.”"
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, escalating his response to a mysterious affliction that has stricken American Embassy personnel in Havana in a move that cast a Cold War chill over relations between the two countries.The order to the diplomats to leave the United States constituted the latest in a series of actions by Mr. Trump to unwind the détente between the United States and Cuba undertaken by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama sought to end the hostility and mistrust that had characterized the relationship between the two countries for more than a half-century, and regarded the resumption in relations as one of his foreign policy legacies.The Cuban government condemned what it called a “hasty, inappropriate and unthinking” decision motivated by politics, and warned that the diplomatic dispute would sour relations already imperiled by Mr. Trump’s move to crack down on travel and commerce with the island nation.The State Department said the expulsion of the diplomats was intended to force Cuba to place its embassy in Washington, where the diplomats were stationed, on the same emergency status that the United States is now operating under in Havana after it decided last week to pare its staff there down to a skeletal group of just 27 people.Still, taken together with a policy directive that Mr. Trump issued in June and a State Department warning last week admonishing Americans not to travel to the island nation, the embassy drawdowns have the potential to freeze the normalization process in its tracks.They make it more difficult for citizens of both countries to engage with each other, imperiling already narrow channels of trade and commerce that opened after the 2014 rapprochement, and all but shutting down the immigration pipeline that allows Cubans to reunite with their families on American soil.A State Department official said the action did not signal a change in policy or an official determination that Cuba was responsible for the illnesses, which have confounded American investigators trying to locate their cause.But the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, said the Cuban government had not done enough to protect Americans on its soil, and would need to ensure that the illnesses would not continue before personnel in either embassy could return.American diplomats and their spouses began reporting symptoms that included hearing loss, dizziness, balance and visual problems, headaches and cognitive issues last December. By late January, the State Department realized that the illnesses were related and might have resulted from some sort of attack, perhaps by a sonic device, toxin or virus.The number of personnel thought to have been affected has gradually grown over the months, and on Tuesday the State Department added one more to the list, bringing it to 22.In a statement, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the United States was expelling the Cuban diplomats “due to Cuba’s failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention.” Mr. Tillerson added that “this order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations.”In a briefing with reporters Tuesday morning, a State Department official said the Cuban ambassador in Washington was informed of the expulsions in a 9 a.m. phone call from Francisco Palmieri, the top State Department official for the Western Hemisphere. The expelled embassy personnel were given seven days to leave the United States. The American Embassy in Havana will have completed its own drawdown by Friday.“We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba,” Mr. Tillerson said, “and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks.”The Cuban government accused the Trump administration of using the health crisis as an excuse to drive out Cuban diplomats without any proof that Havana was responsible. At a news conference in Havana, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Cuba’s foreign minister, said the move was “eminently political” as well as “unwarranted and unjustifiable.”Mr. Rodríguez faulted the American government for not reporting the ailments its diplomats suffered earlier to authorities in Cuba. The Cuban government, he said, has been denied access to the affected American personnel and the doctors who treated them, which has stymied Cuba’s ability to help with the investigation.“Cuba has never perpetrated, and will never perpetrate, any type of attacks against diplomats or their relatives — no exception,” Mr. Rodríguez said. Nor, he added, would it allow a third party to do so. He dismissed accounts of hearing loss and other symptoms as “science fiction.”Daniel Erikson, who as a White House and State Department adviser on Latin America during the Obama administration was deeply involved in the 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, said the severe cutback in diplomats in Havana could blind the United States during Cuba’s crucial political transition next year, when President Raúl Castro is expected to retire and a new generation of leaders take over.“It looks like what began as a legitimate effort to protect American diplomats from harm is moving to a broader breakdown in U.S.-Cuban relations,” Mr. Erikson said.The expulsions were cheered by opponents of the normalization, including members of the Cuban exile community, historically hostile to a Castro government, and condemned by supporters of warmer relations between Cuba and the United States, who said the move threatened to create a new chapter of hostility and play into the hands of those who wish to drive the two countries apart.It would be especially damaging, proponents of engagement argued, if — as many current and former officials suspect — the Cuban government is not behind the attacks.“If this is not the government, but rather other forces seeking to undermine the U.S.-Cuba relationship, a permanent downgrade would accomplish that objective for them,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the former Obama administration deputy national security adviser who helped to negotiate the move toward normalization.But Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a leading foe of closer relations between the two countries, said the expulsions were a fitting response to Cuba’s misbehavior. He and other Republicans had called on Mr. Tillerson in a letter last month to go a step further, declaring all Cuban diplomats in the United States “persona non grata,” a dramatic diplomatic stigma that results in banishment with no right to return.“The idea that over 20 American Embassy personnel could be severely injured in Cuba & the Cuban govt. not know about it is ridiculous,” Mr. Rubio wrote Tuesday on Twitter.Some of those who were affected reported hearing odd sounds in particular rooms of their homes, leading some experts to speculate that some kind of sonic weapon or faulty surveillance device may have been at fault. F.B.I. agents investigating in Cuba have not been able to find the causes of the ailments.With little hard evidence in hand, former American officials who follow Cuba closely have entertained a handful of theories that involve a third country, such as Russia — which would have an interest in driving a wedge between Cuba and the United States as the election approaches — or North Korea, which has en embassy in Havana. Neither scenario seems plausible without some level of Cuban government complicity, these officials say, considering how rigorously Cuba’s intelligence service tracks diplomats on the island.The administration expelled two low-level Cuban diplomats in May in response to the illnesses, but with more diplomats and their spouses becoming ill, calls grew on Capitol Hill for a more forceful response.In the meantime, Mr. Trump in June announced he was “canceling the last administration’s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,” although the stricter travel and commercial regulations he ordered would fall well short of doing so, and have yet to materialize.Career American diplomats leaving Havana expressed regret on Tuesday that their missions were coming to an end.“I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,” Scott Hamilton, the top American official in Cuba, wrote on Facebook. “Hasta la próxima, Cuba.”"
"It is a little unsettling that the intellectual underpinning of tax policy in the United States today was jotted down on a napkin at the Two Continents Restaurant in Washington in December 1974.That was when, legend has it, Arthur Laffer, a young economist at the University of Chicago, deployed the sketch over dinner to convince Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, aides to President Gerald R. Ford, that raising tax rates would reduce tax revenue by hampering growth.It was another economy. The top marginal income tax rate was 70 percent then. For three decades, just over 10 percent of the nation’s income had gone to the 1 percent earning the most. Economists believed Simon Kuznets’ proposition that though market forces would widen inequality at early stages of growth, further economic development would ultimately lead it to narrow. The paramount policy challenge of the day was how to raise productivity.To many economists, Mr. Laffer’s basic argument that high taxes would at some point discourage effort and reduce growth made sense: Why work or invest more if the government will keep almost all the fruits of your troubles? Even Arthur M. Okun, who had been President Lyndon B. Johnson’s chief economic adviser, was writing about leaky buckets to illustrate a trade-off between efficiency and equity: Taxing the rich to pay for programs for the poor could slow growth down, in part by reducing the incentive of the rich to earn more.It is unclear whether reality ever followed Mr. Laffer’s prescription. “In 1986 we dropped the top income tax rate from 50 to 28 percent and the corporate tax rate from 46 to 34 percent,” said Bruce Bartlett, a policy adviser in the administration of President Ronald Reagan. “It’s hard to imagine a bigger increase in incentives than that, and I can’t remember any big boost to growth.”Nonetheless, tax policy today is still being driven by his decades-old argument, devised in an economy that looks nothing like today’s.Today, 1 percent of the population is taking in more than 20 percent of the nation’s income, twice as much as when the fateful dinner took place. Today’s top marginal tax rate, 39.6 percent, is a little over half what it was then.Critically, how the pie is sliced has become as important as how to raise productivity further. Indeed, the questions are intertwined. Compelling new economic research suggests that in the economy in which we live, cutting taxes on the rich further won’t just fail to foster growth, it could even make the economic pie smaller.The direct case against lower taxes on the rich was made most clearly a few years ago by the French economist Thomas Piketty — noted for his analysis of inequality trends over the centuries — and colleagues from the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard University.Looking at a set of industrialized countries from the 1970s until the years preceding the financial crisis, the economists found no meaningful correlation between cuts in top tax rates and economic growth. Big tax cutters like the United States did not grow faster than countries like Denmark, which kept taxes high. What did respond to lower taxes was inequality: The income share of the top 1 percent grew much more sharply among big tax cutters like the United States than in countries like France or Germany, where top tax rates changed little.The findings contradicted the basic proposition on Mr. Laffer’s napkin. Indeed, they suggested an entirely different dynamic: Lower taxes did encourage executives and other top earners to raise their incomes, but not in ways that benefited the entire economy, like working and investing more. Instead, they were encouraged to manipulate the system in ways that, in fact, reduced the pie for everybody else, putting every decision at the service of increasing their pay.Think about tax avoidance or outright evasion — which simply hides money from the Treasury, reducing the government’s ability to fund often critical programs, at no gain to the economy. But executives have been known to use other tricks — say, options backdating or earnings manipulation, or simply lobbying the compensation committee of their company’s board, or putting corporate strategy at the service of the current quarter’s earnings to give the share price a bump.Taking into account all the ways top earners respond to taxation, Mr. Piketty and colleagues suggested that the optimal top tax rate on the Americans with the highest incomes — the rate raising the most money for the government — could exceed 80 percent with no harm to growth. Loopholes would have to be closed to prevent avoidance, but only the mega-rich would lose out. From an economic perspective, soaking the rich would, in fact, do good.The argument that inequality matters little and redistribution mars economic success has always been suspect. In more unequal societies, the disadvantaged will have less access to many of the things that improve productivity, like education, health and the internet. Rising inequality can hamper consumption by weighing on the income of the middle class.Douglas W. Elmendorf, former head of the Congressional Budget Office and now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, once said that to assess the macroeconomic impact of cutting taxes and spending, it is indispensable to assess which taxes are cut and what spending is affected. “Major changes to benefits for lower-income people could have notable effects on the economy by altering labor supply, and those effects could be an important criterion in evaluating such changes,” he argued.In more unequal societies, the rich have more power to distort policy making to channel more of the fruits of growth in their direction by, say, cutting taxes and government spending that might improve productivity and growth. Politics becomes more polarized. And it becomes more difficult to recover from economic shocks: Citizens in unequal societies are less likely to buy government promises that sacrifice today will lead to gains tomorrow.“We have not paid enough attention to macro distributional linkages,” said Jonathan D. Ostry, deputy head of research at the International Monetary Fund, who has published groundbreaking research linking inequality and growth. “Even if you are only interested in the aggregate gains, you are forced to think about equity, because equity matters for the aggregate. The distribution might come back to bite you.”Mr. Laffer may still be calling to cut tax rates, to provide an incentive for executives to earn even more. But tax policy today calls for a new napkin, one with a place for equity."
"WASHINGTON — Justice Anthony M. Kennedy has long been troubled by extreme partisan gerrymandering, where the party in power draws voting districts to give itself a lopsided advantage in elections. But he has never found a satisfactory way to determine when voting maps are so warped by politics that they cross a constitutional line.After spirited Supreme Court arguments on Tuesday, there was reason to think Justice Kennedy may be ready to join the court’s more liberal members in a groundbreaking decision that could reshape American democracy by letting courts determine when lawmakers have gone too far.Justice Kennedy asked skeptical questions of lawyers defending a Wisconsin legislative map that gave Republicans many more seats in the State Assembly than their statewide vote tallies would have predicted. He asked no questions of the lawyer representing the Democratic voters challenging the map.There was something like consensus among the justices that voting maps drawn by politicians to give advantage to their parties are an unattractive feature of American democracy. But the justices appeared split about whether the court could find a standard for determining when the practice was unconstitutional.“Gerrymandering is distasteful,” said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., “but if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something that’s manageable.”Some of the court’s more liberal members said the problem represented a crisis for democracy and that the Supreme Court should step in.“What’s really behind all of this?” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked. She answered her own question: “The precious right to vote.”In extended remarks, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. expressed worry that the court’s authority and legitimacy would be hurt were it to start striking down voting districts in favor of one political party or another.“That is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country,” he said.Paul M. Smith, a lawyer for the Democratic voters, urged the court to act. “You are the only institution in the United States that can solve this problem just as democracy is about to get worse because of the way gerrymandering is getting so much worse,” he told the justices.Without the Supreme Court’s intervention, Mr. Smith said, other states will follow Wisconsin’s lead. The round of redistricting that will follow the 2020 census, he said, “will produce a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen.”The Supreme Court has never struck down an election map on the ground that it was drawn to make sure one political party wins an outsize number of seats. The court has, however, left open the possibility that some kinds of political gamesmanship in redistricting may be too extreme.The problem, Justice Kennedy wrote in a 2004 concurrence, is that no one has devised “a workable standard” to decide when the political gerrymandering has crossed a constitutional line.On Tuesday, he pressed Erin E. Murphy, a lawyer for Wisconsin lawmakers, about whether a state law could require drawing districts to have the maximum number of votes for a given political party. Other justices followed up on the point, and Ms. Murphy gave equivocal answers.Justice Kennedy grew frustrated. “I have to say that I don’t think you ever answered the question,” he said.Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Ms. Murphy more fundamental questions.“Could you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering?” Justice Sotomayor asked. “How does that help our system of government?”Ms. Murphy said that gerrymandering “produces values in terms of accountability that are valuable so that the people understand who isn’t and who is in power.”That did not seem a sufficient reason, Justice Sotomayor said, “to stack the decks.”Much of the argument concerned various statistical tests for identifying extreme gerrymandering. Misha Tseytlin, Wisconsin’s solicitor general, said the challengers were relying on flimsy and hypothetical social science evidence.“Plaintiffs are asking this court to launch a redistricting revolution based upon their social science metrics,” he said.Chief Justice Roberts told Mr. Smith that courts are poorly equipped to evaluate social science data. “It may be simply my educational background,” the chief justice said of the studies before the court, “but I can only describe it as sociological gobbledygook.”Other justices seemed more comfortable with the studies.“This is not kind of hypothetical, airy-fairy, we guess, and then we guess again,” Justice Elena Kagan said. “I mean, this is pretty scientific by this point.”Justice Sotomayor said that “every single social science metric points in the same direction.”There may be close cases, Justice Kagan said, but this was not one of them. “This map goes pretty much over every line,” she said.Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in remarks that may have been aimed at Justice Kennedy, sketched out a series of criteria that he said amounted to a workable standard. He said courts should act only when there is one-party control of the state government and a map that creates a persistent and unjustified partisan advantage that is “an extreme outlier” when compared to other maps.“I suspect that that’s manageable,” Justice Breyer said.The case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, started when Republicans gained complete control of Wisconsin’s government in 2010 for the first time at the beginning of a redistricting cycle in more than 40 years. Lawmakers promptly drew a map for the State Assembly that helped Republicans convert very close statewide vote totals into lopsided legislative majorities.In 2012, after the redistricting, Republicans won 48.6 percent of the statewide vote for Assembly candidates but captured 60 of the Assembly’s 99 seats.Democratic voters sued, saying the maps violated the Constitution. “This is one of the most extreme gerrymanders ever drawn in living memory of the United States,” Mr. Smith said on Tuesday.The case is part of a larger debate over politics in redistricting, one that has taken on new urgency with the advent of sophisticated software. Both parties have engaged in partisan gerrymandering, but these days, Republicans have an advantage following a wave of victories in state legislatures that allowed lawmakers to draw election maps favoring their party.Some critics, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former governor of California, say districts should be drawn by independent commissions rather than politicians. Prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., are pushing to undo the redistricting gains Republicans made after the 2010 census when the next census is taken three years from now.Outside the court during the arguments, several dozen activists rallied with signs that read “Equal Districts Under Law” and “Hands off our Districts!”Mr. Schwarzenegger, who attended the argument, said afterward that he is hopeful that the justices will put a stop to partisan gerrymandering.“We are here today to ask the Supreme Court to fix something that the politicians will never do,” he said. “As Einstein said, those who created the problem will not be able to solve it.”Last year, a divided three-judge Federal District Court panel ruled that Republicans in Wisconsin had gone too far. The map, Judge Kenneth F. Ripple wrote for the majority, “was designed to make it more difficult for Democrats, compared to Republicans, to translate their votes into seats.”The decision was the first from a federal court in more than 30 years to reject a voting map as partisan gerrymandering.Wisconsin officials say that the lopsided representation of Republicans in the State Legislature is a product of geography rather than gerrymandering. Democrats have packed themselves into cities, effectively diluting their voting power, while Republicans are more evenly distributed across most states, the brief said.Judge Ripple acknowledged that the distribution of the population explains at least some part of the gap.“Wisconsin’s political geography, particularly the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban centers like Milwaukee and Madison, affords the Republican Party a natural, but modest, advantage in the districting process,” he wrote.But he added that partisan gerrymandering amplified that advantage."
"WASHINGTON — For lunch on April 26, Scott Pruitt, the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, dined with top executives from Southern Company, one of the nation’s largest coal-burning electric utilities, at Equinox, a white-tablecloth favorite of Washington power brokers.That evening, it was on to BLT Prime, a steakhouse inside the Trump International Hotel in Washington, for a meal with the board of directors of Alliance Resource Partners, a coal-mining giant whose chief executive donated nearly $2 million to help elect President Trump.Before those two agenda items, Mr. Pruitt met privately with top executives and lobbyists from General Motors to talk about their request to block an Obama administration move to curb  emissions that contribute to climate change.It was just a typical day for Mr. Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general. Since taking office in February, Mr. Trump’s E.P.A. chief has held back-to-back meetings, briefing sessions and speaking engagements almost daily with top corporate executives and lobbyists from all the major economic sectors that he regulates — and almost no meetings with environmental groups or consumer or public health advocates, according to a 320-page accounting of his daily schedule from February through May, the most detailed look yet at what Mr. Pruitt has been up to since he took over the agency.Many of those players have high-profile matters pending before the agency, with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in regulatory costs at stake. Some of these same companies and trade associations were allies of Mr. Pruitt when, as Oklahoma’s attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. at least 14 times to try to block rules Mr. Pruitt is now in charge of enforcing.He also took several trips home to Oklahoma for long weekends, often with one or two brief work meetings, followed by long stretches of downtime.E.P.A. officials defended Mr. Pruitt’s industry-heavy appointment book.“As E.P.A. has been the poster child for regulatory overreach, the agency is now meeting with those ignored by the Obama administration,” an emailed statement from the agency said, adding that the agency believed that The New York Times was making an “attempt to sensationalize for clicks” the administrator’s detailed calendar.But William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. administrator under the first President George Bush, described the level of meetings between Mr. Pruitt and industry executives as unusual.“My sense is there is almost nothing about this administration that is traditional,” Mr. Reilly said. He said Mr. Pruitt’s history of suing the E.P.A. should have prompted him to meet regularly with public health advocates and environmentalists.“I would think he would feel a responsibility to bend over backward to show a sense of judicious impartiality,” Mr. Reilly said.In just the first 15 days of May, Mr. Pruitt met with the chief executive of the Chemours Company, a leading chemical maker, as well as three chemical lobbying groups; the egg producers lobby; the president of Shell Oil Company; the chief executive of Southern Company; lobbyists for the farm bureau, the toy association and a cement association; the president of a truck equipment manufacturer seeking to roll back emissions regulations for trucks; and the president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.The E.P.A. leader also scheduled a call with the Family Research Council, whose self-described mission is to “advance faith, family and freedom in public policy and the culture from a Christian worldview.” The topic: pulling “together a small group of key business leaders around the country who are very excited about Administrator Pruitt’s new leadership role.”In recent weeks, Freedom of Information Act requests from environmentalists, other nonprofit groups and news organizations including The Washington Post have dislodged documents that hint at Mr. Pruitt’s typical day. But for the first time, the most recent release, based on an open records request by the liberal nonprofit American Oversight, includes a description of the topics discussed at each of the meetings, and a list of all the agency officials and corporate executives scheduled to attend.Mr. Pruitt also has made frequent, government-funded trips to his home state of Oklahoma, even when the journeys included only a bit of official business. A trip to Oklahoma on May 5, which cost $1,043, was justified by the E.P.A. as an “informational meeting.” It consisted of a one-hour sit-down that Friday with Sam Wade, the chief executive of the National Rural Water Association, then a return flight to Washington the following Monday.Mr. Pruitt flew to Oklahoma on May 19, a Friday, toured a chemical company for three hours the next day, then returned to Washington on Monday. The flight for that trip cost $2,122. These trips are being examined by the agency’s inspector general. In later trips Mr. Pruitt appears to have scheduled a greater number of meetings around trips to Oklahoma, such as a three-day trip in July during which he toured a Phillips 66 energy plant, spoke to the Chamber of Commerce in Tulsa, held a round table on the rollback of a Clean Water Act regulation and met with Gov. Mary Fallin.Mr. Pruitt generally takes commercial flights when he travels, records show, but on at least one occasion he flew on a much more expensive charter flight, and on two other occasions, on federal government and military planes, after getting authorization from agency officials.But many of Mr. Pruitt’s trips outside Washington, the records show, also involved speeches to industry groups and conservative activists who worked closely with the energy industry to challenge the Obama administration’s regulatory agenda.Destinations included the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort in Naples, Fla., in late April, where Mr. Pruitt spoke to the National Mining Association; the Phoenician, a golf resort and spa in Scottsdale, Ariz., where he spoke to the National Association of Manufacturers; and the Broadmoor, a Colorado Springs hotel, for a gathering of conservative activists, sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, where the agenda included sessions like “Innovative Ways to Roll Back the Administrative State.”The Times also examined more than a year’s worth of calendar records maintained for Gina McCarthy, Mr. Pruitt’s predecessor under President Barack Obama, which also demonstrated a partisan bent. Ms. McCarthy held a disproportionate number of meetings with Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, particularly in the summer of 2014, when the administration was making the case for sweeping climate-change regulations.But the documents show Ms. McCarthy apparently spent much more time meeting with E.P.A. professional staff and other federal government officials than Mr. Pruitt, discussing agency programs and policies. She also met with industry players, like the American Gas Association, the National Pork Producers Council and Edison Electric Institute, the utility lobby.One of Mr. Pruitt’s first scheduled meetings with a public health advocacy group, according to the calendar, came on May 24 when he sat down with the American Academy of Pediatrics. A day later he had two meetings with environmental activists, including a group called Trout Unlimited, a conservation group. Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said the agency (she would not specify who) had met with more than two dozen other health and environmental groups, including the Audubon Society and the American Lung Association.The newly released documents, for the first time, create a direct link between Mr. Pruitt’s meetings and actions that the industry wants him to take.The oil and gas industry, for example, opposed an Obama-era rule that required it to collect information on the emission of methane, a gas that is considered at least 25 times as effective at warming the planet as carbon dioxide.On March 27, A.J. Ferate, the vice president of regulatory affairs at the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, saw Mr. Pruitt for half an hour in the administrator’s office to offer, according to the schedule notes, “just a few words of appreciation for canceling the Information Collection Request (ICR) on the oil and gas industry.” Mr. Ferate and Mr. Pruitt had been working together since at least 2011 — when Mr. Pruitt was Oklahoma’s attorney general — to try to kill the methane rule.The calendars show how companies often turn to people with close personal ties to Mr. Trump or Mr. Pruitt to set up meetings. Roy W. Bailey, the Texas co-finance chairman for the Trump campaign, helped organize a meeting for Intrexon, a Maryland company that wants E.P.A. approval for a biotech-based mosquito control system. Jessica M. Garrison, a former consultant to the Republican Attorneys General Association, helped set up the lunch that Mr. Pruitt had at Equinox with electric utility executives.The schedule also includes a number of meetings with automakers who pressed the Trump administration to roll back Mr. Obama’s decision to lock in vehicle emissions rules through 2025. Mr. Pruitt met in his office on March 17 with the chairman of BMW, Harald Krüger. On April 27, Mr. Pruitt met with G.M. a second time, along with nine other automakers represented by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The topic: “key E.P.A. priorities affecting the auto industry.”Mr. Pruitt in late April welcomed five executives from a trade association representing sorghum cereal grain growers, including their lobbyist, Joe Bischoff, a former official at the Department of Agriculture. The message they offered Mr. Pruitt: The industry had “witnessed significant pesticide-related restrictions and the threat of revocation of more than half of the crop’s reliable insecticides.”Representatives from CropLife America, a trade association run by giant pesticide companies such as Dow AgroSciences and Bayer CropScience, separately met with Mr. Pruitt to “acknowledge the many actions taken already to correct recent regulatory overreach.” The meeting with CropLife came the day after Mr. Pruitt overruled E.P.A. scientists who had recommended that the agency ban a pesticide named chlorpyrifos, which has been blamed, in E.P.A.-funded research, for causing developmental disabilities in children, particularly among the families of farm workers.Another theme emerges in the calendar: Industry executives and conservative activists often scored meetings to press Mr. Pruitt to kill or modify Obama-era climate change regulations, particularly the so-called Clean Power Plan. A May 18 conference call included representatives from the State Policy Network and American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization with ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialists.“Many people on this call were leading the Clean Power Plan pushback in their state and are advocates for devolving decision making to the local level,” the calendar notes.The E.P.A. is expected to issue a legal justification and plan for rescinding the Clean Power Plan as soon as this week."
"WASHINGTON — Dozens of assailants had burst into the main villa of the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya, on the night of Sept. 11, 2012, trashing the building and pounding on a metal cage door protecting a safe area where Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens; Sean Smith, a computer technician; and Scott Wickland, a diplomatic security officer, crouched out of view.It seemed clear that they were all about to die, Mr. Wickland testified Monday, the first day of the trial of Ahmed Abu Khattala, who is accused of helping orchestrate the attacks. Then the attackers left, but moments later, thick black smoke from a fire they had set started to pour in. Mr. Wickland told the others to follow him as they crawled to a bathroom window, but he lost them in the choking blackness.“To this day, I don’t even know where they went,” he said. “I was right next to them, and then that’s it.”The harrowing testimony from Mr. Wickland, appearing in United States District Court in Washington, capped a day that began with the prosecution’s opening statement laying out the case that Mr. Khattala conspired in, and aided, the attacks. It was underscored by surveillance video clips showing armed men bursting into the American Mission complex, manhandling an unarmed Libyan guard, kicking at doors, stealing maps and carrying cans of fuel that they used to set the deadly blaze.But Mr. Wickland’s testimony did not mention Mr. Khattala’s role, and the video clips showed him only briefly coming into the compound late in the attacks. Government video of the height of the assault showed many of the assailants circled in red, each of whom were identified by a prosecutor as Mr. Khattala’s associates.“Abu Khattala didn’t do the killing by himself,” John Crabb Jr., an assistant United States attorney, told the jurors. “He didn’t light the fires and he didn’t fire the mortars. But you will hear that he is just as guilty as the men who lit those fires and the men who fired those mortars because Abu Khattala planned the attack. Abu Khattala set the attack in motion. Abu Khattala incited others to do his dirty work.”But Jeffrey D. Robinson, a defense attorney, argued that Mr. Khattala was being scapegoated. While the attacks were tragic, he said, no credible evidence would show that his client was responsible.“The evidence is going to show that there were other people who were the brains behind the attack and masterminded the attack,” Mr. Robinson said. “Mr. Abu Khattala is just someone who we have decided — the government has decided, Libya has decided — can be blamed.”Mr. Khattala, who is 46 but looks older with gray hair and a gray beard, sat quietly at the defense table and listened to an Arabic translation through headphones.Four Americans died in the attacks. Mr. Stevens and Mr. Smith died from smoke inhalation in the burning building at the mission. Hours later, two Central Intelligence Agency operatives, Glen A. Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods, were killed by mortar fire at a nearby C.I.A. annex.The men were killed, Mr. Crabb said, “because they were Americans.”“And that man right there,” he continued and pointed to Mr. Khattala, “hates Americans with a vengeance.”The trial, which may take five weeks, is being closely watched because a political firestorm followed the attacks. It also is a test of handling a foreign terrorism suspect in civilian court. Special Operations commandos captured Mr. Khattala in 2014 at a seaside villa in Libya, and he was interrogated aboard a naval ship.The opening statements made clear that a Libyan witness, identified as “Ali,” will be important in the case. Mr. Crabb said that the United States government persuaded Mr. Ali to get close to Mr. Khattala after the attacks, and that it was Mr. Ali who eventually lured him to the villa. Mr. Ali received $7 million.According to Mr. Crabb, Mr. Ali will testify that he witnessed Mr. Khattala describe himself, during a civic meeting at a Benghazi mosque, as the person who had attacked the Americans. The prosecutor said that Mr. Ali will also testify that during a visit to Mr. Khattala’s apartment, he saw equipment stolen from the mission building and heard Mr. Khattala say that he would have killed “all the Americans” that night if others had not stopped him.But Mr. Robinson, emphasizing the money Mr. Ali was paid, argued that Mr. Ali had merely told American officials what they wanted to hear.Mr. Crabb cited other upcoming evidence against Mr. Khattala, including testimony that he gathered weapons to be used in the attacks a few days beforehand, and kept potential rescuers from approaching as it was happening.Mr. Robinson questioned the credibility of Libyan witnesses. He also said his client came to the American mission after the attacks started, out of curiosity, warned people to stay away from the gunfire for safety reasons and went home before the assault on the C.I.A. annex.“The government’s theory is he was sort of a hands-off person and sent other people to go do it,” Mr. Robinson said. “You don’t go home if you are planning and leading an attack on a C.I.A. annex in Benghazi, Libya. That doesn’t make sense.”While Mr. Wickland’s testimony offered no insights about Mr. Khattala’s role, it left a vivid impression. After searching fruitlessly in the smoke for the other two men and nearly passing out, he testified, he got out of a window into breathable air — only to be shot at.He returned inside four times to search but periodically went to vomit outside, where he was shot at again, Mr. Wickland said. Finally, he sought refuge on the roof of the burning building.“I waited until the firing stopped on my position for a second, bolted for the ladder onto the roof of the building, pulled up the ladder behind me,” he said. “And that’s pretty much when I knew Sean Smith and the ambassador were dead.”"
"WASHINGTON — In the absence of any hint of a motive in the Las Vegas massacre, President Trump late Monday morning called it “pure evil.” Notably, he avoided the word “terrorism.”The gunman, Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old  with no significant criminal history and no obvious ideological motive, remained a blank space, offering little for Americans who crave an explanation for the tragedy to seize upon.But that did not deter a daylong jumble of industrious, contradictory and often self-interested speculation.Early in the day, right-wing websites named the wrong man as the gunman, labeling him “another angry far-left shooter,” in the words of the Gateway Pundit. A conservative Las Vegas radio personality, Wayne Allyn Root, told his 110,000 Twitter followers: “This is real thing. Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack” — an early guess given a brief boost by a claim of responsibility from the Islamic State.Then the F.B.I. knocked down the Islamic State angle, noting that the group has a history of false claims. The guessing game resumed: Was it a plot by “deep-state Democrats” (Alex Jones of the conspiracy site Infowars) or perhaps divine punishment for the “profound disrespect” shown to Mr. Trump and the national anthem (the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson)? Was it something to do with country music, given the concert crowd Mr. Paddock targeted? Could it be linked in any way to the long-ago history of Mr. Paddock’s father as a bank robber on the F.B.I.’s most-wanted list?“Stephen Paddock motive” ranked high among Google searches, and it remained uncertain whether more evidence would fill the void about what drove his killing rampage or the slaughter would drift into history as one more act of American mass violence to elude easy categorizing.Mass killing of innocents, even on the scale of Las Vegas, does not automatically meet the generally accepted definition of terrorism, which requires a political, ideological or religious motive. But beyond that academic analysis, in political debate in a polarized country, the word “terrorism” is also a verbal weapon, freely wielded — especially when the accused is Muslim.“The label is so powerfully pejorative and carries so much weight,” said Martha Crenshaw, a terrorism expert at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation.The first reports of any mass attack summon not only a general sense of grief, but anxieties and wishes in specific American subgroups: Muslim Americans pray that the attacker does not share their faith, for instance; conservatives and liberals alike want the assailant to turn out to be a member of their political opposition.“In today’s political climate, it’s so polarized that people are hoping it’s not pinned on their side,” Ms. Crenshaw said. As a political progressive, she admitted to a passing feeling of dread on Monday that the gunman might come from the left.More cynical observers of American politics may feel that Mr. Paddock’s advanced age, white race and non-Muslim religious background make it less likely that he will be tagged a terrorist, whatever may emerge about his politics.And this gruesome tragedy, perhaps the deadliest single shooting episode in American history, quickly and predictably reopened a debate on gun control. If Mr. Paddock’s purpose was uncertain, his choice of weapons was unmistakable.The tussle over what terrorism is dates back to the beginning of its modern history, said David C. Rapoport, the dean of American historians of terror. He said a Russian radical who shot the governor of St. Petersburg in 1878, Vera Zasulich, was asked at trial why she laid down her gun after merely wounding her target.“I’m not a criminal — I’m a terrorist,” she declared, he said, suggesting that she had made her political point and felt no need to pile on with lethal violence.“That’s not our conception of terrorism,” said Mr. Rapoport, a retired professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and founding editor of the journal Terrorism and Political Violence.Mr. Rapoport’s well-known taxonomy identifies four major waves of terrorism since the 1880s: the anarchists; anticolonial activists; leftists around the time of the Vietnam War; and since 1979, religious zealots, including non-Muslims. He said each of the earlier waves lasted about 40 years, and that he expected the period of religious terrorism to fade by 2025.But in every case, the perpetrators had a clear ideological agenda. They were also overwhelmingly young, Mr. Rapoport said. Mr. Paddock so far seems to fit none of the patterns. His age, a year short of qualifying for Medicare, is especially perplexing.Still, the phenomenon of mass shooting, whether or not it properly carries the terrorist label in a particular case, is a recognizable American phenomenon. And from the point of view of potential victims, the crucial factor may not be a specific ideological motivation but the decision to target random, innocent people.Homicides in the United States rose more than 8 percent in 2016, to 17,250, the F.B.I. reported last month. But most killings by far have a clear answer to the question of why. Many are crimes of passion; many others accompany robberies, sexual assaults or disputes inside the drug trade or other criminal enterprises.Shooting down systematically from a hotel window on a crowd of 22,000 people enjoying a concert is a different matter, said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State who studies terrorism. Even if that name does not apply, Mr. Paddock’s baffling attack unquestionably spread terror far beyond Las Vegas.“The question people ask about this kind of violence is, Can I imagine myself in the situation of the victims?” Mr. Mueller said. “In this case, the answer is absolutely yes.”"
"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Republican leaders have positioned their sweeping tax rewrite as a way to cut taxes on the middle class. But some top officials are now saying the plan may not benefit everyone in that income group.The acknowledgment could complicate the administration’s ability to sell the tax plan, which is already facing questions from Republicans and Democrats over the cost and effect of the ambitious rewrite.Those questions have gotten more pronounced after an analysis last week by the Tax Policy Center, which found that the plan could cost $2.4 trillion over the next decade, with the biggest benefits flowing to businesses and the wealthiest Americans. The analysis found that nearly 30 percent of those in the middle class could see their taxes increase as a result of changes to the deductions and exemptions many middle-class Americans rely on to lower their tax bills.The breakdown is based on the framework released by the “Big Six” group of Republican lawmakers and administration officials, which did not include many details that could change the distributional impact, including an increase to the child tax credit and the potential for a higher tax rate on the richest Americans. Yet top officials acknowledged this weekend that a tax cut for everyone in the middle class may not be achievable.“You can’t make guarantees because every single person’s taxes are different,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in comments to ABC News on Sunday. “People take advantage of different things, so we can’t make that guarantee. But we can say that’s our objective and that’s what we’re working to, and we want to protect the middle class.”The comments are a break from the 2016 presidential campaign, when Mr. Trump’s advisers promised he would instruct Congress to write a bill that did not increase taxes for any low- or middle-income taxpayers. Stephen Miller, who advised Mr. Trump during the campaign and is now his chief policy adviser, said that “in sending our proposal to the tax-writing committees, we will include instructions to ensure all low- and middle-income households are protected.”Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said on Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that while the “purpose of this is to get a middle-class tax cut,” it is impossible to ensure that every middle-class American would see their tax bill go down.The framework proposes to double the standard deduction for individual taxpayers and increase the child tax credit by an undetermined amount. It would eliminate some personal exemptions and several deductions, including those for state and local taxes and for out-of-pocket medical costs.The elimination of the state and local tax deduction could adversely affect those in the upper middle class, who tend to make heavy use of the tax break. More than a third of the taxpayers who earn $150,000 to $300,000 could see their taxes go up next year, the Tax Policy Center report stated. The average tax bill for all income groups would decline by $1,600, or 2.1 percent, in 2018, the report said.A tax plan that does not offer a cut for everyone in the middle class could hurt its chances as Republicans try to pass a bill largely along party lines.On Monday, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, tweeted a critique of the new analysis.Republicans have signaled that they will try to push any tax bill through the Senate reconciliation process, which would make it immune to a Democratic filibuster. That means Republicans can afford only two Senate defections from their ranks if they hope to pass a bill.Mr. Paul was one of a handful of Republican senators whose public opposition doomed a health care bill that party leaders attempted to pass via reconciliation in September.“We know that the rich guys are going to be fine,” said Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “The real question is what happens at the bottom.”Without specifying more details, such as the income thresholds for each tax bracket, Republicans cannot rule out tax increases on, for example, a middle-class family of four that incurs high medical costs not covered by insurance. Economists say such a family could end up paying more if the value of the new tax rates and expanded standard deduction falls short of the value of tax breaks the family enjoyed previously.Party leaders say they are taking steps to protect middle-class families from tax increases.On Monday, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, laced into the Tax Policy Center projections, calling them a “work of fiction that Stephen King would have been proud of.” Mr. Brady said that it was impossible to assess the tax plan without details on what income levels would fall into the new tax brackets or the size of the yet to be determined child tax credit.“They’re just guessing, and guessing poorly,” Mr. Brady said.But Mr. Brady would not definitively guarantee that no middle-class taxpayers would see their tax bills increase from the final tax legislation.“I will guarantee that we are going to work hard to lower taxes on every American, increase their paychecks and dramatically simplify the code for them,” he said.Pressed as to whether some may still face higher tax bills, Mr. Brady added, “I guarantee we are going to improve the lives of every American by driving down taxes and increasing paychecks.”"
"NEWARK — A “visibly angry” Senator Robert Menendez grew increasingly “hostile” during a phone call with a top official from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2009, eventually hanging up on the official, according to testimony.And Mr. Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, maintained a similar angry disposition during a meeting in 2012 with Senator Harry Reid and Kathleen Sebelius, who at the time was the secretary of Health and Human Services, according to Jonathan Blum, who participated in the call and in the meeting, and who took the witness stand in a federal courtroom here on Monday.The description of the two interactions by Mr. Blum, a former principal deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, offered a window into direct action taken by Mr. Menendez on behalf of his friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy ophthalmologist, who was involved in a dispute over whether he had overbilled Medicare by roughly $8.9 million.Mr. Menendez’s actions are a part of the corruption case he faces in which he is accused of using the power of his office to benefit Dr. Melgen in exchange for luxurious gifts and political donations. Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen, who is also charged in the case, have denied any wrongdoing.In both instances, Mr. Blum said, Mr. Menendez never specifically mentioned the doctor by name but still railed against a billing practice that Mr. Blum said he knew affected only one person: Dr. Melgen.While Mr. Blum stated that interactions with members of Congress were common, he said his interactions with Mr. Menendez stuck out in his mind for two reasons.“One is the tone of the conversation was very aggressive, was very adversarial,” he said. “And two, that most of my interactions, just about every interaction I had with a member of Congress, was either about a national policy that affected a million stakeholders throughout the country or about a specific issue in that member’s own state or district.”Dr. Melgen, he pointed out, is from Florida.“I pressed several times to understand, from our staff, the connection between the senator and Dr. Melgen,” Mr. Blum said.After about 15 minutes, Mr. Blum said, “the call was ended quite quickly.”James P. Cooney, a federal prosecutor, asked Mr. Blum to clarify what he meant by “very quickly.”“I believe that he hung up on me.”A defense lawyer, during cross-examination, sought to make clear that the senator never mentioned the doctor.“You do not recall Senator Menendez ever raising Dr. Melgen?” Kirk Ogrosky, a defense lawyer for Dr. Melgen, asked Mr. Blum.“I don’t believe he did, no,” he answered.In his questioning, Mr. Ogrosky repeatedly discussed the intricacies of the billing practices at the center of Dr. Melgen’s dispute: The doctor was dividing a single-dose vial into multiple doses and then charging Medicare based on the doses and not the vial, a complicated practice known as multidosing.And, Mr. Ogrosky said, the senator’s tone with Mr. Blum was not one of hostility, but of frustration at confusing health policies.But his examination was routinely interrupted by objections from the prosecutors, prompting Judge William H. Walls to excuse the jury and reprimand Mr. Ogrosky, who defended his line of questioning.“They put this witness on the stand to say Menendez’s tone was to strong-arm the government into doing something,” Mr. Ogrosky told the judge. “And I’m showing that his frustration was born out of the substance of what this witness knows.”Mr. Blum also recalled a similarly contentious meeting three years later that he took part in along with Ms. Sebelius, Mr. Reid, Mr. Menendez and aides.“I felt like I was being put on the defensive, and it was a very angry exchange,” Mr. Blum said.At one point, he recalled, Mr. Menendez said that Mr. Blum was contradicting positions he had previously stated publicly.“He handed me a transcript about a deposition,” Mr. Blum said. “I pointed out very quickly that the person that was giving that deposition was not me.”Mr. Menendez handed the sheet back to an aide and continued questioning Mr. Blum. After about 30 minutes, the two men were visibly irritated, Mr. Blum testified, and Ms. Sebelius said she had to leave for another meeting.Mr. Menendez told both Mr. Blum and Ms. Sebelius that he ”was not going to let the issue rest,” Mr. Blum testified, and “that he was going to use the authority that he had being a member of the Senate Finance Committee to press the issue going forward.”But, Mr. Blum continued, Mr. Menendez never followed through and the issue never came up again.The trial recessed on Monday before Mr. Menendez’s lawyers could cross-examine Mr. Blum."
"WASHINGTON — In its first argument of the new term, the Supreme Court on Monday considered whether to give employers a powerful tool to bar class actions over workplace issues.The court’s decision on the matter could affect some 25 million employment contracts. A ruling in favor of employers, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said, could cut out “the entire heart of the New Deal” and undo an understanding of labor relations with roots in the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.The case is the court’s latest attempt to determine how far companies can go in insisting that disputes be resolved in individual arbitrations rather than in court.The Supreme Court ruled in earlier cases that companies doing business with consumers may require arbitration and forbid class actions in their contracts, which are often of the take-it-or-leave-it variety. Such contracts typically require two things: that disputes be resolved by arbitration and that claims be brought one by one. That makes it hard to pursue minor claims that affect many people, whether in class actions or in mass arbitration.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there was often no point in pursuing individual arbitration because the sums at issue were too small.“There is strength in numbers,” she said. “We have to protect the individual worker from being in a situation where he can’t protect his rights.”Jeffrey B. Wall, a deputy solicitor general who argued in favor of the employers, acknowledged that it was sometimes a consequence of arbitration agreements “that the employees would be practically unable to vindicate their claims.” He added that the Supreme Court had said as much about arbitration clauses generally in a 2013 decision concerning an agreement among businesses.Arbitration clauses with class-action waivers are now commonplace in contracts for things like cellphones, credit cards, rental cars and nursing home care.In a 2015 dissent, Justice Ginsburg, citing a New York Times article examining arbitration agreements, wrote that the court’s decisions favoring arbitration “have predictably resulted in the deprivation of consumers’ rights to seek redress for losses, and, turning the coin, they have insulated powerful economic interests from liability for violations of consumer protection laws.”The court’s earlier arbitration decisions were closely divided, with its conservative members in the majority.The question for the justices on Monday was whether they should use a different approach for employment contracts. The answer depends on the interaction of two federal laws. One, the Federal Arbitration Act, favors arbitration. The other, the National Labor Relations Act, protects workers’ rights to engage in “concerted activities.”Workers seeking to sue their employers for overtime pay and the like say the second law prohibits arbitration clauses that require class-action waivers.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy seemed to be ready to side with employers. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, the court’s newest member, asked no questions.Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the employers, said the labor law was “directed to the workplace, not the courthouse.”Justice Ginsburg said the arbitration law was concerned with agreements between merchants of relatively equal bargaining power. The employment contracts at issue in the case, she said, have been forced on workers.“There was no true liberty of contract,” she said.Monday’s argument concerned three cases: Epic Systems Corporation v. Lewis, No. 16-285, Ernst & Young v. Morris, No. 16-300 and National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, No. 16-307.The cases, which were consolidated for a single hour of argument, featured an unusual element: Lawyers for the federal government appeared on both sides.The Obama administration had filed a brief supporting the workers on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board. The Trump administration reversed course, and Mr. Wall argued on behalf of the employers.The labor board’s general counsel, Richard F. Griffin Jr., argued for the workers. He made a concession at odds with the position of another lawyer on his side.Mr. Griffin said that employment contracts could not require workers to give up collective action in arbitration but that the private entities that conduct arbitration could require that cases be pursued one by one.If that is so, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. responded, “you have not achieved very much because, instead of having an agreement that says no class arbitration, you have an agreement requiring arbitration before the XYZ arbitration association, which has rules that don’t allow class arbitration.”Daniel R. Ortiz, a law professor at the University of Virginia who also argued for the workers, took a different approach.“When an employer tries to coerce by making it a condition of continued employment that employees agree to a set of arbitral rules that make collective action impossible,” he said, that would be unlawful.Some justices suggested that workers could band together in a limited sense by hiring the same lawyer and filing individual arbitration cases.Justice Elena Kagan said that was not good enough.“The fact that there is one way to exercise a right left over does not make it O.K. if we’ve taken away another 25 ways of exercising the right,” she said. “You know, when we think about the First Amendment, we don’t say we can ban leafleting because you can always write an op-ed.”"
"It took nearly two hours from when President Trump signed his first attempt at a travel ban for the head of United States Customs and Border Protection to get an official version of the president’s executive order.In the hours that followed, officials scrambled to figure out how to enforce the order and — as protesters, lawyers and politicians swarmed airports — they monitored the demonstrations with detailed granularity, setting up a “Crisis Action Team” to coordinate their response.As officials begin to roll out President Trump’s latest attempt to severely restrict visitors from certain countries, internal documents provided to The New York Times offer a look at how the government tried to carry out his initial attempt at a travel ban.The documents, which are dated from Jan. 27 (the day the first executive order was signed) to Feb. 4 (the day after a federal judge temporarily blocked the order from being enforced nationwide), depict an all-night sprint to implement the rules on the fly — a process filled with stops and starts, confusion and lots of conference calls.Vera Eidelman, a fellow with the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the heavily redacted documents through public records requests, said in an email the group believes that the internal emails, memorandums and spreadsheets “are just the tip of the document iceberg, and do not reveal the full story.”She wrote they show that “it wasn’t just the public that was confused about the Muslim Ban — top officials were, too.”She added that nearly 2,000 travelers were subjected to extended questioning in the first week after the order.Michael Friel, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said he was not authorized to speak about specific internal correspondence. Speaking generally about policies and procedures, he said, “We have real-time information and intelligence that arise, and this organization is very experienced with adapting on a dime.”When an order comes down, he said, “there is an implementation that occurs, and with any implementation you’re going to need to coordinate it and communicate about it.”It was late on a Friday afternoon when President Trump signed the order blocking entry of refugees and citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries for varying lengths of time.The action led to chaotic scenes at American airports as human rights advocates, lawyers and the travelers themselves — some aboard flights in midair — tried to figure out what to do.Top government officials sought guidance from the White House when the order was signed. The Times reported in January that Customs and Border Protection was among the agencies caught off guard.The documents reviewed by The Times help illustrate some aspects of the confusion at the agency.At 5:24 p.m., about 40 minutes after Mr. Trump signed the order, Kevin McAleenan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, asked in an email whether the agency had official confirmation it had been signed.“Any way I can get the latest version electronically?” he asked in an email to several officials.A minute later, an official replied, “they really need the signed version to assist in execution.” At 6:32 p.m., Mr. McAleenan received the final version.The documents also include lengthy updates on the airports where protests occurred and details on the number of protesters, news reporters and politicians present, as well as the response by the police.Emails detail the back and forth between officials as they tried to figure out whether the order was applicable to green card holders. Soon after Mr. McAleenan got the signed order, he asked about that issue.Gene Hamilton, a senior counselor at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote that green card holders should generally be given a case-by-case exemption, “provided that it is in the national interest to do so (i.e. provided that there is no security risk posed, meaning that there should be a revetting of sorts).”That response appeared to surprise Mr. McAleenan, who noted that under such an interpretation, the number of travelers affected would significantly increase. “We have 300 in the air inbound right now,” he said in an email, adding, “wanted to flag this as our understanding has changed.”The documents show agency officials over the next several days held conference calls and drafted memos to guide employees on how to carry out the order and how to report their progress. Some memos explained who had the authority to grant waivers for green card holders, and documents also show officials sent requests for those waivers.On Feb. 1, Don McGahn, counsel to President Trump, sent a memo clarifying the order did not apply to green card holders after all.Two days later, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked Mr. Trump’s order from being enforced nationwide.At 8:23 p.m. that day, there was a memo from Mr. McAleenan that read in part, “suspend any and all actions.”"
"Rumors and conspiracies have proliferated in the aftermath of the Sunday night shooting at a Las Vegas music festival that left at least 59 dead. Viral falsehoods include: false allegations about the gunman, a person of interest and Nevada’s gun control laws. More below.Before the police named Stephen Paddock as the gunman, some bloggers and social media users incorrectly pointed to a man named Geary Danley as the “murderer.” In a now deleted post, the right-wing blog The Gateway Pundit called Mr. Danley “a far left loon” and noted that he had followed several pages dedicated to liberal politics on Facebook.All of these claims are untrue.The unfounded rumors appear to have originated on the anonymous messaging board 4chan.ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack and said the gunman had recently converted to Islam. But an FBI spokesman has said there is no proof so far that Mr. Paddock had any ties to international terrorist groups.Still, some social media accounts spread the unfounded claims that Mr. Paddock has been radicalized.The New York Times reporter Rukmini Callimachi, who has covered ISIS for several years, noted on Twitter that the organization has incorrectly claimed responsibility for two recent attacks, casting further down on any assertion of an ISIS connection.Additionally, Graeme Wood, who has reported on ISIS for The Atlantic, noted that Mr. Paddock was a gambler and had committed suicide, actions that are at odds with ISIS’ ideology.Facebook and Twitter users have connected Marilou Danley, a woman whom law enforcement officials initially described as a “companion” of the gunman, with a viral video to suggest that she knew in advance the shooting would happen and was perhaps complicit in it. In the video, an unnamed concertgoer recounted her experience with two people who she said had told a group, “You’re all going to die,” before being escorted out of the concert.There is no evidence in the video that Ms. Danley had been identified by the witness. The police have since said that Ms. Danley was out of the country at the time of the shooting and is no longer a person of interest.As has become common in the aftermath of an event with unidentified victims, social media has been a tangled web of users expressing legitimate concern for missing loved ones and pranksters polluting social streams with fakery.Several news outlets have done a fine job flagging fakes that include pranksters repurposing the photos of a German soccer player, a murder suspect in Mexico, a porn star and random social media stars. In a telling exchange, Gianluca Mezzofiere of Mashable reached out to the operator of one Twitter account sharing misinformation and reported the following:Some inaccurate claims have popped up in post-shooting debates over gun control. Some are asserting that automatic weapons are “already illegal” in Las Vegas.That’s not exactly true. To start, it’s not yet known what kind of weapons Mr. Paddock used. Police reports suggest he had at least 10. The rapid pace at which he fired has led to informed speculation that at least one weapon may have been fully automatic, like a machine gun. But nothing had been confirmed by the time these messages were posted to social media.Also, while it’s true that a provision of the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 banned civilian purchases of machine guns across the country, the provision also grandfathered in weapons that were made and registered before May 19, 1986. In response to a recent Freedom of Information Act request, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives counted some 175,000 transferable machine guns in the national registry as of December 2015.Several states, like Iowa and Hawaii, have restrictions on the possession of machine guns in addition to the 1986 law. But there are none in Nevada, according to the National Rifle Association, where “it is lawful to possess, purchase or sell a machine gun or silencer that is legally registered and possessed in compliance with all federal laws and regulations.”Are you seeing other questionable information about the shooting in Las Vegas?

"Activists are working to bring a steel sculpture of a 45-foot-tall nude woman to Washington, where she will temporarily face the White House from a perch on the National Mall.Transporting the sculpture from its home in San Francisco will be an undertaking, but its artist, Marco Cochrane, said he saw it as an opportunity to start a conversation about violence against women.His creation, called R-Evolution, depicts a short-haired, nude woman standing in mountain pose — a yoga posture chosen by the sculpture’s model, the singer and songwriter Deja Solis.The sculpture invites viewers to imagine a world where women are safe and live without fear, Mr. Cochrane said.“For her to be able to just stand there and express nothing, just to be present in the moment, is a really powerful statement,” he said.The sculpture was created for the Burning Man festival in 2015 but is being repurposed for Catharsis on the Mall, a gathering in Washington that seeks to bring about social change. Organizers plan to install it over six days in November and leave it in place until March.It will cost $90,000 to move R-Evolution and install it. As of Monday morning, a campaign on a crowdfunding website had raised 30 percent of the money to transport the sculpture.Mr. Cochrane’s collaborator and partner, Julia Whitelaw, said the sculpture’s positioning on the National Mall was not directed at the Trump administration. She said Catharsis on the Mall organizers had discussed bringing the sculpture to Washington before Mr. Trump was elected.Even so, she added, President Trump has made derogatory comments about women. “We are hoping that he will see this sculpture and come experience her and change his perspective,” she said.The National Park Service is still reviewing the group’s proposal, Russell Newell, a spokesman for the Department of the Interior, said in an email.Robert Haferd, who is leading Catharsis’s efforts to gain a permit, said his group was providing the government with additional details.“Since they’ve reviewed our plans and the preparation is going well, we’re confident,” he said.Catharsis on the Mall is scheduled for Veterans Day weekend, Nov. 10-12, but the sculpture would remain in place for up to four months to raise awareness about the Equal Rights Amendment, organizers said. The first anniversary of the Women’s March is Jan. 21, 2018.One of the permit conditions would require Catharsis to provide enough volunteers to keep watch over the sculpture around the clock for four months. That will be one of the biggest challenges, Sanam Emami, a spokeswoman for Catharsis on the Mall, said in an interview.This year’s theme is “Nurturing the Heart,” Ms. Emami said, a nod to “the intense political and social divisions that we’re experiencing individually and as a community.”Ms. Emami said that when she looked at the sculpture she saw a strong woman who was “making no excuses and making no apologies, but just taking ownership of the space that is rightfully hers.”Mr. Cochrane, who has been creating sculptures for 25 years, said he was driven to focus on the female form after being haunted by stories he heard as a 7-year-old about the abduction and rape of a childhood friend who was 9.“It’s not a priority in our culture to protect and support women,” he said. “To make sculptures of women who are just being people seemed to me to be a way to humanize this form, which is so sexualized.”"
"Two high school students in Texas were kicked off their football team on Friday night after they demonstrated during the national anthem to protest racial inequality.One student, Cedric Ingram-Lewis, 16, raised a fist in the air while the anthem played. The other, Larry McCullough, 18, got down on one knee. In response, their coach told them to hand over their uniforms, The Houston Chronicle reported.“We had to get our message across: End racial injustice and the oppression of black people,” Mr. Ingram-Lewis said in a phone interview on Sunday.The coach, Ronnie Mitchem, is the pastor at Victory and Praise Worship Center in Crosby, Tex., and a Marine Corps veteran. In a phone interview on Sunday, he said the teenagers’ demonstration was offensive to people who served in the military.“I’ve been very patriotic my whole life,” he said. “I believe everybody has a right to protest, and I let those guys do their protests. But the rule was, if you did this protest, you wouldn’t be on the team.”The two teenagers, who are cousins, decided to demonstrate even though Mr. Mitchem had warned players the day before against protesting, Mr. Ingram-Lewis said. After the anthem, Mr. Mitchem told them to return their uniforms, which they did.Last year, the N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick was playing for the San Francisco 49ers when he began kneeling during the anthem to protest racial inequality, attracting national attention. He is now a free agent.At a political rally in Alabama on Sept. 22, President Trump denounced professional athletes who did not stand during the playing of the anthem. He added that they should be fired and that any team owner who followed his advice would become “the most popular person in the country” for a week.His comments are part of what prompted widespread demonstrations on Sept. 24, when scores of N.F.L. players knelt, raised a fist or locked arms during the anthem to protest racial inequality, setting off fierce national debates. Last week, several high schools stepped into the fray by warning students not to kneel during the anthem at sports events, with some threatening disciplinary action.Still, some students were reported kneeling during the anthem in towns across the country, from Vancouver, Wash., to New Brunswick, N.J., to Austin, Tex. In contrast, one team in Fannin County, Ga., had its players carry American flags while running onto the field.Mr. Mitchem said his football team was a small church-based operation with no high school affiliation.“They know that when I make a rule, I make a rule,” he said of his players. “I’m trying to teach the guys respect, and in our program, we do more than just play football. We teach guys how to shake hands with somebody, look them in the eye, be a man.”He said he cared about Mr. Ingram-Lewis and Mr. McCullough and would consider letting them play again as long as they did not protest during the anthem.Mr. McCullough could not be reached but Mr. Ingram-Lewis said he did not regret leaving the team, adding that his demonstration was not about disrespecting the flag or the military.“That’s not our intent. That wasn’t Kaepernick’s intent when he first kneeled,” he said. “It was about police brutality and racial injustice.”"
"SAN FRANCISCO — The Russians who posed as Americans on Facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises.There was “Defend the 2nd,” a Facebook page for gun-rights supporters, festooned with firearms and tough rhetoric. There was a rainbow-hued page for gay rights activists, “LGBT United.” There was even a Facebook group for animal lovers with memes of adorable puppies that spread across the site with the help of paid ads.Federal investigators and officials at Facebook now believe these groups and their pages were part of a highly coordinated disinformation campaign linked to the Internet Research Agency, a secretive company in St. Petersburg, Russia, known for spreading Kremlin-linked propaganda and fake news across the web. They were described to The New York Times by two people familiar with the social network and its ads who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.Under intensifying pressure from Congress and growing public outcry, Facebook on Monday turned over more than 3,000 of the Russia-linked advertisements from its site over to the Senate and House intelligence committees, as well as the Senate Judiciary Committee. The material is part of an attempt to learn the depth of what investigators now believe was a sprawling foreign effort spanning years to interfere with the 2016 United States presidential election.“We’re obviously deeply disturbed by this,” Joel Kaplan, Facebook vice president for United States public policy, said in an interview. “The ads and accounts we found appeared to amplify divisive political issues across the political spectrum,” including gun rights, gay rights issues and the Black Lives Matter movement.Facebook declined to name or confirm any specific groups or advertisements, citing legal restrictions and ongoing participation with federal investigators. Several of the pages with Russian links were leaked or have been identified by reporters. The Times was told of at least seven Russia-linked Facebook groups by the people familiar with the investigation, some of which were previously unreported.Late Monday, Facebook said in a post that about 10 million people had seen the ads in question. About 44 percent of the ads were seen before the 2016 election and the rest after, the company said.The scope and types of the Facebook content being handed over underline the complicated nature of the investigation, and the degree to which the social network — home to more than two billion regular visitors — has been used to manipulate Americans and foment public unrest.Facebook revealed on Sept. 6 that it had found 470 pages and profiles linked to the Internet Research Agency. It said the pages had purchased the 3,000 ads, a sampling of which has been shown to the Senate and House intelligence committees investigating the Russian influence campaign.In a live video address on his Facebook page last month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, acknowledged the gravity and novelty of the tactics used across his network.“Many of these dynamics were new in this election, or at much larger scale than ever before in history, and at much larger scale than the interference we’ve found,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.Since Facebook’s public disclosures, the cross hairs have widened to encompass other companies in Silicon Valley and what part, if any, their networks had in shaping the 2016 election’s outcome.Last week, Twitter said it had discovered more than 200 accounts with links to the Russia-controlled pages Facebook had found.  Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized the company for failing to look beyond the Facebook research for stealth Russian activity on its platform.And on Friday, Google said it would also cooperate with congressional inquiries into the election. The internet search giant has started an investigation internally into whether its advertising products and services were used as part of the Russia-linked influence campaign.Officials from all three companies have been asked to testify at public congressional hearings on the Russian operations before the House committee this month and the Senate committee on Nov. 1.While American intelligence agencies concluded in January that a major goal of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, was to damage Hillary Clinton, the Facebook operation shows the Russian government reached deeply into polarizing political issues on multiple fronts. Russia experts said Mr. Putin hoped to mar the image of American democracy and handicap the United States’ international influence.In every case, the voices posed as Americans and presumed to speak for like-thinking fellow citizens: anti-immigration zealots, gun-rights advocates, gay rights supporters, African-American activists — and, more incongruously, dog lovers, according to the two people familiar with the sampling of advertisements.The LGBT United page and a Twitter account called @LGBTuni, featuring a rainbow symbol, declared: “We speak for all fellow members of LGBT community across the nation. Gender preference does not define you. Your spirit defines you.”The Defend the 2nd page appeared to have spread messages of support for gun rights.“Why do I have a gun?” asks a young woman in one image that appears to be associated with the page. “Because it’s easier for my family to get me out of jail than out of cemetery.” (The image and slogan seem to be borrowed from real gun activists, but the dropped “a” before “cemetery” is a characteristic mistake for Russians speaking English.)Part of Facebook’s challenge in rooting out bad actors speaks to the very nature of how the company’s entire network is built. In some cases, the Russian-linked accounts created Facebook groups and posted images and content aimed to spread quickly across Facebook.To aid the viral spread, these accounts paid for “boosted posts” — Facebook’s name for one of its paid advertisements — to appear interspersed in users’ news feeds, the central column filled with status updates and photos from friends. Those posts often included a call to action, like asking users to join a bogus group or share the post.Moreover, the disinformation campaign spread well beyond Facebook to sites like Reddit, Instagram, 4chan and Imgur — other popular online social networks — making it more difficult for any one company to curb the tide of fake accounts.In at least one case, authentic American activists actually engaged the Russian fakes. When the “Blacktivist” Facebook page and Twitter account — now suspected of being linked to Russia — called for a march in Baltimore amid the turmoil that came after the death in police custody of a black man, Freddie Gray, a genuine local activist confronted the Blacktivist operator via Twitter.The Rev. Heber Brown III, pastor of a Baltimore church, asked Blacktivist if those behind the account were in Baltimore. The person or people behind the account responded that they were not but “we are looking for friendship, because we are fighting for the same reasons. Actually we are open for your thoughts and offers.”Mr. Brown replied that they should “come learn and listen before you lead” and urged Blacktivist to apologize publicly. When he learned on Friday, first from a CNN report, that the account originated in Russia, Mr. Brown tweeted his amazement that he had not been correcting an overeager out-of-town activist but had unwittingly been “disrupting a Russian op.”Another page, called “Secured Borders,” offered a stream of inflammatory anti-immigrant commentary. One called “Heart of Texas” agitated for that state’s secession. A third, “Being Patriotic,” tried to rally Floridians in favor of the Trump campaign.The goal of the dog lovers’ page was more obscure. But some analysts suggested a possible motive: to build a large following before gradually introducing political content. Without viewing the entire feed from the page, now closed by Facebook, it is impossible to say whether the Russian operators tried such tactics.Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent now at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, said Russia had been entrepreneurial in trying to develop diverse channels of influence. Some, like the dogs page, may have been created without a specific goal and held in reserve for future use.“They were creating many audiences on social media to try to influence around,” said Mr. Watts, who has traced suspected Russian accounts since 2015.Facebook said it was taking steps to fight back. The company plans to hire more than 1,000 new employees for its ads review team, and said it would cooperate and share what it learned with other technology companies. It also plans to restrict “more subtle types of violence” from appearing in ads, and will require more thorough documentation to verify the identities of advertisers who wish to buy political ads.On Saturday, at the conclusion of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur — the “Day of Atonement” — Mr. Zuckerberg, who is Jewish, also appeared penitent.“For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness,” he wrote in a post to his personal Facebook page. “I will work to do better.”"
"WASHINGTON — President Trump called on the nation to seek “unity and peace” on Monday, in the aftermath of one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. Less than two hours later, he offered conciliatory words to the people of Puerto Rico, promising to visit the hurricane-ravaged island on Tuesday, the day before he travels to Las Vegas.The week will pose the greatest test yet of whether a president who plays to America’s divisions can also appeal to its sense of national unity, whether it is binding the wounds left by a rampaging gunman or the wreckage left by a deadly hurricane.Whether Mr. Trump can sustain his empathetic tone over what promise to be two emotional, exhausting days also is an open question — particularly as critics attack his position on gun laws, or if he faces further criticism from local officials in Puerto Rico over the slow-to-start relief effort there. On Monday afternoon, some of the president’s aides were urging him to put off the trip to Puerto Rico because they worried that he could be set off by protests.Over the weekend, Mr. Trump launched an acrid attack on the mayor of San Juan after she criticized the federal response to Hurricane Maria. While subdued so far about the Las Vegas massacre, he was already facing critics who said his embrace of gun rights abets the kind of violence that targeted a concert crowd outside a casino late Sunday night.Hours later, at the White House, a somber Mr. Trump quoted Scripture and talked about the search for “some kind of meaning in the chaos.” He said nothing about his own connection to Las Vegas: The mass shooting happened at the other end of the city’s Strip from his 64-story luxury hotel, which is wrapped in gold-mirror glass and stamped with the Trump name.“Our unity cannot be shattered by evil,” the president said, reading slowly from a teleprompter. “Our bonds cannot be broken by violence. And though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today – and always will, forever.”It was a rigorously disciplined performance from a president who, as a candidate, regularly seized on mass shootings to warn of the threat posed by what he calls “radical Islamic terrorism,” and to justify banning immigrants and foreign visitors from mostly Muslim countries.He was similarly restrained about Puerto Rico. After a weekend of restless tweeting about Hurricane Maria – during which Mr. Trump accused San Juan’s mayor, Carmen Yulín Cruz, of being “nasty to Trump” and claimed Puerto Ricans “want everything to be done for them” – the president on Monday tried to put the focus back on humanitarian relief.“We’re going to be seeing the people of Puerto Rico,” he told reporters, before a meeting with the prime minister of Thailand. “There’s never been a piece of land that we’ve known that was so devastated.”The White House sought to tamp down both brush fires. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said the administration had invited Ms. Cruz to take part in the president’s meetings on Tuesday. “We hope that she will join with us in those efforts,” Ms. Sanders said.Echoing a line typically used by gun-rights advocates, Ms. Sanders said now was not the time to open a new debate over gun laws. But she noted that Mr. Trump campaigned as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, and made clear the White House was not interested in restricting gun ownership.“If you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country,” she said. “That certainly hasn’t helped there.” She added, “When that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we need to look at things that may actually have that real impact.”At the White House – where the chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was briefed on the shooting in its immediate aftermath, sometime around 3 a.m. in Washington, and told the president about it some time between 5:30 a.m. and 6:15 a.m. – the day unfolded with a mixture of solemn ceremony and urgent consultations.Mr. Trump ordered flags lowered to half-staff. At 2:45 p.m., he and the first lady, Melania Trump, walked out to the South Lawn, under a brilliant early-autumn sky, to take part in a moment of silence for the victims.Mr. Trump spoke to the governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval; the mayor of Las Vegas, Carolyn Goodman; and the sheriff of Clark County, Joseph Lombardo. At the same time, the White House staff struggled with the logistics of a visit by the president and a half-dozen cabinet secretaries to the islands devastated by the hurricane. They also opted to have the governor of the United States Virgin Islands, Kenneth E. Mapp, fly to Puerto Rico rather than have Mr. Trump make several stops.Mr. Trump’s five-minute statement about the Las Vegas shootings was a group effort, officials said. Among the key contributors were Rob Porter, the staff secretary; Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s main speechwriter; and Thomas P. Bossert, the Homeland Security adviser, a person familiar with the process said.For Mr. Trump, the rhythms of grief after a national tragedy have never come naturally. After five police officers were murdered in Dallas in July 2016, Mr. Trump’s aides coaxed the presumptive Republican nominee into delivering a pretaped statement in which he said the shootings had “shaken the soul of our nation.”That statement stood in contrast to some of the heated responses Mr. Trump has unleashed after other attacks. During the 2016 election, he frequently fired off tweets within hours of an extremist attack, often saying it vindicated his own view of terror threats.“Appreciate the congrats,” Mr. Trump tweeted the day of a deadly shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., by the American-born son of Afghan immigrants, who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State.Mr. Trump’s anger at instances involving reports of radical Islamist assailants has nearly always been instantaneous, while his response to other violence, like the bombing of a mosque in Minnesota, has been more muted. After the Orlando shooting, Mr. Trump reiterated his call for a temporary ban on Muslims traveling into the United States — a proposal he first made in December 2015, after the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., that also were linked to the Islamic State.Mr. Trump has been less vocal about the role of guns in attacks. The National Rifle Association flooded airwaves with ads in support of Mr. Trump during the 2016 race. He often talked about “Second Amendment people” as his base of support, even once suggesting at a rally that they could take matters into their own hands to prevent Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency.On Monday, advisers were mostly pleased with Mr. Trump’s response to the bloodshed. The president, who pledged to stop “American carnage” in his Inaugural Address, refrained from reactive tweets that could have undermined his morning statement.Since taking office, one senior administration official noted, Mr. Trump has generally been more reserved about attacks that have taken place on American soil as opposed to violence abroad. He also tends to be more comfortable around law enforcement officials, almost guaranteeing he will be looser on Wednesday in Las Vegas than in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump, insisted the president had an impulse to unify people in his previous life as a real estate developer and entertainer. “I think politics brought out a side of him where he feels like he has to strike back every time,” he said."
"Sebastian Gorka’s voice rippled with contempt as he announced, on behalf of Donald J. Trump, that the old Washington establishment was obsolete. Declaring it was time for “new ideas,” Mr. Gorka, then a White House aide, packed disdain into a cryptic phrase that could have been borrowed from science fiction — a space-age update on the Bolsheviks’ “dustbin of history.”“We’re not going to stay in the Washington bubble,” Mr. Gorka proclaimed on television, “or the Acela corridor of wonkery.”With its Asimovian name, wielded these days as a vaguely derisive epithet, the Acela might sound to an untrained ear like something exotic, even menacing. The reality is far more pedestrian: The Acela is a train.In the most literal sense, it is Amtrak’s version of luxury rail, traversing a line between Boston and Washington. The Amtrak website boasts of “speeds up to 150 mph,” a figure worth boasting about in a region plagued by dysfunctional railways, though sluggish compared with its European and Asian cousins.At the moment, the train is famous less for moving passengers than for sorting them into a cultural set. Not since the Concorde’s last flight in 2003 has a means of transportation given the language such an evocative code word for a way of life — the flitting between cities of Northeastern elites, whose values and habits are said to have been repudiated in the last election.Sinister cabal or not, the Acela people are an orderly bunch: They march on board in single file, a loose column of pressed shirts and tightly packed totes, rolling luggage and newspapers folded under their arms. When they disembark, they are slightly rumpled, perhaps more than slightly late, agitated by splenetic tweeting and an excess of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee that sells for $3.50 in the cafe car.Lizzie O’Leary, the New York-based host of the public radio show “Marketplace Weekend” and a frequent Acela rider, shrugs off all the recent train-shaming. Ms. O’Leary, who relies on the Acela to visit her family in Washington, has become an Emily Post-like figure in the Amtrak community.She has a voluble Twitter account that deals extensively with the etiquette of the quiet car, a supposedly placid zone adjacent to the first-class compartment, where cellphone conversations are banned.“I love the Acela,” she said. “I live for the three hours of peace where I can just read or do work.”Ms. O’Leary noted the difference between the seasoned riders who navigate the train by instinct — they have a favorite car and snack, often the $6 cheese plate — and the wide-eyed new arrivals. Scattered throughout the cars, she said, are the “performatively important,” ostentatiously high-powered riders who treat the Acela’s two-by-two seats as personal boardrooms.“You’re going to have a lot of jerks, and you’re going to have a lot of people who think their time is extremely valuable,” Ms. O’Leary said. “That’s why I sit in the quiet car.”The physical experience of traveling by Acela is nothing special: The train lurches and sways, making the walk to the cafe car or restroom an acrobatic exercise.It is not necessarily markedly cheaper than air travel — a ticket from New York to Washington ranges from $165 to $289, one way (first-class costs up to $421)— but the Acela offers more generous legroom, and the Wi-Fi, at least, comes free. Adherents insist the trip, which lasts just under three hours, is competitive with air travel, factoring in delays on the Van Wyck Expressway and on the tarmac.The relative conveniences are such that when President Trump’s health secretary, Tom Price, was found by Politico to have taken an exceptionally costly private flight from Washington to Philadelphia, a puzzled cry went up: Why not take the Acela?“This is why people argue about the quiet car!” John Berman, a CNN anchor, said on air last week. “It’s because that train exists. You don’t need to take a private jet.” (Mr. Price resigned on Friday, after his penchant for chartered air travel became public.)For some imaginative passengers, the halting motion of a train evokes a certain time and lifestyle, when Eastern aristocrats shuttled between cities without a hint of bashfulness or self-deprecation, simply because it was the finest way to travel.“When I’m on it, I think of all the political intrigue that’s transpired, all the corporate deals that have been brokered and even the occasional cultural masterpiece that’s been conceived over the same lines,” said Keith MacLeod, a lawyer in Boston who often rides the Acela.Mr. MacLeod invoked Teddy Roosevelt and Joseph P. Kennedy riding between Boston and New York, “and, my favorite of all, George Gershwin writing ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ on his way to a premiere in Boston, and being inspired by the rhythm of the train.”What passes for railway intrigue now is less romantic: In 2013, a liberal activist caused a stir by live tweeting an indiscreet telephone conversation between Michael Hayden, the former C.I.A. director, and a reporter. In 2007 Arianna Huffington wrote of having eavesdropped on Bill Kristol, the conservative columnist, as he enthused about the White House’s messaging on the Iraq war.Mr. Kristol, no friend of the current White House, remains an Acela loyalist, and he has embraced the “Acela corridor” designation along with unfashionable labels like “establishment” and “globalist.”When a Trump supporter taunted him online earlier this summer, saying Mr. Kristol never made a crowd chant like the president, Mr. Kristol fired back on Twitter: “I’d normally be too modest to report this, but crowd WAS chanting ‘Kristol Kristol Kristol’ as I boarded Acela this a.m. at Union Station.”Mr. Kristol said his affection for the train was partly tongue-in-cheek, calling it “no great shakes.” He described the Acela’s atmosphere with a gentle irony some people reserve for friends and family.“If you haven’t ridden the Acela while trying to prevent your Dunkin’ Donuts coffee from spilling,” Mr. Kristol wrote in an email, “while also pretending to ignore nearby riders, who include three McKinsey consultants energetically discussing their spreadsheets, two Europeans vividly lamenting the state of America, and a lawyer sharply berating a junior associate for his failings, have you really lived life in the New York-D.C. corridor to the full?”"
"WASHINGTON — The Republican tax plan is built around a goal of cutting corporate taxes, but party leaders now face a key question: Can they afford to make those changes permanent?Business leaders and conservative economists say a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate, as opposed to a temporary, 10-year cut, is the best way to spur robust investment and job creation as well as generate the kind of economic growth Republicans say will pay for the tax plan.But a new analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says the corporate tax cuts will cost nearly $7 trillion over the next two decades — $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years and another $4.1 trillion from 2028 through 2037. The hit would be somewhat offset by revenue raised from individual taxpayers over that same period — $470 billion over the next 10 years and an additional $1.4 trillion the next decade. But the entire package is expected to cost an estimated $5.6 trillion over the next 20 years — an amount that economists say would be hard to offset through economic growth alone.The ability to pay for the tax cuts matters because of Senate rules requiring legislation that adds to the federal deficit after a decade to expire. If Republicans can’t show that a long-term tax cut will be deficit-neutral, they will have to scale back the size of the corporate tax cuts, make them temporary or find another way to pay for them.The plan now calls for a corporate rate of 20 percent, down from 35 percent; a 25 percent “pass through” tax rate on small businesses; and the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and estate tax, among other business measures. For individuals, it would double the standard deduction; increase the child tax credit; and establish three tax brackets — 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent — with the option of adding a fourth, higher tax bracket for the wealthiest Americans. The plan would also do away with some valuable tax breaks, such as the state and local tax deduction.Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers hit the airwaves on Sunday to sell their plan, saying economic expansion from the cuts would make it fiscally responsible.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, breaking with conventional economic thinking, said on Sunday the tax cuts would actually reduce the deficit because of the economic growth that they would trigger.“With our plan, we actually pay down the deficit by $1 trillion, and we think that’s very fiscally responsible,” Mr. Mnuchin said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Economists have warned against the effectiveness of temporary tax cuts. A study produced last June by the conservative Tax Foundation found that a short-term cut to the corporate tax rate gives a smaller boost to economic growth that diminishes as its expiration date approaches.“Economic growth is much weaker under a temporary cut because investment is a forward-looking behavior,” said Alan Cole of the Tax Foundation. “The specter of a future tax increase makes investment under a low rate less enticing, especially for long-lived assets.”The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in April that a three-year cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent would result in revenue losses of $489.7 billion over 10 years. There would also be additional losses beyond that budget window as companies rushed to bring back money to take advantage of the tax holiday.Congressional tax-writing committees are set to begin turning the nine-page outline released by the so-called Big Six Republican working group into legislation at the same time the House and the Senate work to come to an agreement on budget resolutions this week. The Senate Budget Committee is expected to agree to a resolution as soon as this week that would allow a $1.5 trillion reduction of federal revenues over the next decade.Many of the tax plan’s details remain to be worked out, including several big unknowns that could affect its overall cost, including whether lawmakers add a higher rate on top earners. The working group already agreed to allow for a five-year window for full and immediate expensing of business investments, which will cost $192 billion over that period. Limitations on which businesses qualify for the 25 percent “pass through” rate could be another way to claw back some revenue.They must also come up with “guardrails” to ensure that a new international tax system does not create greater incentives for businesses to keep cash overseas. And the committees still have to address what is referred to as the carried interest loophole, which benefits hedge fund managers, and which President Trump has promised to fix.However, Republicans will face pressure to scale back their ambition of eliminating the state and local tax deduction, which costs $1.3 trillion over a decade but is prized by many lawmakers, including Republicans in high-tax states like New Jersey, Virginia and New York.For now, those responsible for selling the tax plan are staying vague about how they will fit the tax cuts into a $1.5 trillion hole. Instead they are largely taking issue with projections that say the cuts would expand the deficit and disproportionately benefit the rich.“What’s missing from that — and it’s not being hidden, it just doesn’t exist yet — are things like details on the deductions, details on the brackets,” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It is impossible to sit down and say, this will be the impact on this wage earner or this family at this particular time.”Many conservatives would like to see tax cuts paid for with spending cuts, including to safety-net programs like Medicaid. That appears to be off the table, for now.Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the failure of Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act showed that dismantling entitlement programs is politically toxic.“I think we’d kill tax reform if we did,” Mr. Ryan said.As a result, the corporate tax rate cut could be smaller than many conservatives hoped.“You want to make it permanent because businesses like to make long-term investments,” said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who advised President Trump’s campaign. “The idea is to reduce risk and uncertainty, but having a 10-year tax cut adds more risk and uncertainty.”He added that the corporate tax rate could wind up being much higher than what many conservatives believe is the optimal rate to generate growth.“The worry is that you start with 20 now then it migrates to 22 or 24 or 26,” Mr. Moore said. “The final package is going to be scaled back.”"
"WASHINGTON — A recent major exercise by the Russian military revealed significant strides in its ability to conduct the sort of complex, large-scale operations, using drones and other new technology, that would be part of any all-out war with the United States in Europe, according to American and allied officials.Preliminary Pentagon and NATO assessments of the exercise, one of the largest of its kind since the end of the Cold War, are classified and will take months to complete. But Western officials said the military maneuvers, known as Zapad, Russian for “west,” far exceeded in scope and scale what Moscow had said it would conduct, and tracked more closely to what American intelligence officials suspected would unfold, based on Russian troop buildups in August.Before the exercise, Russia said the drills would involve fewer than 13,000 troops engaged in a counterterrorism scenario in Belarus, the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, the Baltic Sea region and around St. Petersburg. Instead, tens of thousands of Russian troops in the Arctic and Far East, the Black Sea, close to Ukraine’s borders and in the Abkhazia region of Georgia also joined in, Western military officials said.“In effect, these activities together constituted a single strategic exercise, involving the full spectrum of Russian and Belarusian military,” said Oana Lungescu, the NATO spokeswoman. That array included warships, submarines, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks and artillery, air defenses, anti-ship missiles, special forces, and short-range and nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles.The military exercise, planned for many months, was part of a larger effort by President Vladimir V. Putin to showcase Russia’s military prowess as it tries to reassert itself as a world power. Beyond Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election in support of the Trump campaign, its military has in recent years dispatched troops to Syria, captured Crimea and intervened in eastern Ukraine, rattled the Baltic States with snap exercises and buzzed NATO planes and ships.Allied military and independent analysts said that over the course of the nearly weeklong Zapad exercise, held from Sept. 14 to 20, Russian armed forces assimilated new technology and integrated information better than in the past to improve the military’s lethality. And the Russian Army demonstrated improved logistics to support war fighters, as well as new technology to conceal and protect those vital supply lines, analysts said.From the foxhole to brigade command posts, Russian soldiers are now using increasingly sophisticated electronic communications gear, and Russian drones have proliferated to the point that they are now a part of almost every exercise.“These are key things to practice for the initial period of war, where time and distance are crucial, and whoever gets there first has a big advantage,” said Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist at the Center for Naval Analyses’ Russia program who chronicled the exercise on his blog. “The exercise did a good job showing how Russia continues to improve combined arms operations, coordinating between different services.”In a Senate hearing last week, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to offer a detailed assessment in the unclassified setting, but told senators, “We watched very carefully what the Russians have done during the Operation Zapad to make sure that we understand where they are in terms of capability development and what the implications are for NATO security and for U.S. security.”Gen. Lori J. Robinson, head of the Pentagon’s Northern Command, which is charged with defending American territory, said at a conference in Washington last week that one emerging conclusion involved Russia’s “ability to hold targets at risk at ranges that we’re not used to,” apparently referring to Moscow’s arsenal of medium- and long-range missiles. She did not elaborate, adding only that her command would conduct a “deep-dive” review of the exercise this week.Part of the exercise took place at the Luzhsky Training Range, a large open space cut from an undulating wooded area, mostly pines, about 100 miles southwest of St. Petersburg. On a rainy Monday afternoon, Mr. Putin arrived by helicopter, and from an enclosed viewing stand watched the proceedings through binoculars.The enemy of the day was a mock foe attacking Russian territory. Ground forces advanced from the left and right. Spectators could hear aircraft overhead, but low clouds obscured them. A seemingly unending stream of bullets, shells and rockets was launched. Large bombs plummeted into the range, sending huge clouds of smoke into the sky, along with giant clods of earth and shock waves toward the spectators.In the distance, cutouts of the enemy soldiers could be seen. But few Russian soldiers were on view. It was very much a display of hardware and high-powered weaponry — tanks driving at high speed, Mi-28 and Ka-52 helicopters swooping in to the attack from both sides, modern rockets as well as the older but terrifying swoosh-sounding Grad launchers. A commentary was broadcast over a loudspeaker system.Mr. Putin sat alongside Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, and Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff. Foreign military observers watched from small covered stands. After the 45-minute exercise, Mr. Putin stayed for another 45 minutes to confer with his commanders, and then flew off.Not everything went as planned during the exercise. At least one bystander narrowly escaped death when a Russian military helicopter accidentally fired rockets into a parking lot next to a firing range near St. Petersburg.While Western military officials emphasized that the United States and Russia are not on the brink of war, they expressed concern that the heightened Russian military activity could lead to unintended confrontations.The Defense Intelligence Agency summed up the exercise this way in an email to The New York Times: “Russia’s forces are becoming more mobile, more balanced and capable of conducting the full range of modern warfare.”Going into the exercise, American and Baltic military officers had expressed fear that the maneuvers could be used as a pretext to increase Russia’s military presence in Belarus, a central European nation that borders three critical NATO allies: Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ordered that a wider array of European partners have access to classified American information during the exercise to simulate conditions during combat. “Zapad forced us to get smarter about how to share intelligence,” said Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the top United States Army commander in Europe.Officials said it was still too soon to determine whether Russia would use the exercises to permanently station more troops and matériel in Belarus. Some American analysts said Mr. Putin would not necessarily need to do so, given that he had successfully carried out an exercise in intimidation that drew worldwide news coverage and recalled the most ominous days of the Cold War.Linas Antanas Linkevicius, Lithuania’s foreign minister, said Belarusian officials had told Lithuania that Russia had not expected to fully withdraw its equipment until Sept. 30, after which NATO allies would be able to see what got left behind, he said. A Belarusian military newspaper reported that the last of the Russian troops had left on Friday.For Lithuania, the exercise helped draw the world’s attention to Russia’s increasingly belligerent actions toward its neighbors, “and that served a very positive purpose, in my view,” Mr. Linkevicius said in an interview.“Everyone was talking about it,” he said. “That’s why it didn’t turn into something other than an exercise.”For Western analysts, the Russian military display might have served an additional purpose: tipping off what Moscow fears most about the United States and its NATO allies. “A lot of attention was paid to fending off a U.S. aerospace operation, shooting down cruise missiles, getting ships out to sea while under incoming missile fire and concealment of moving forces to avoid getting hit,” Mr. Kofman said. “The fear of Western technological superiority and dominance in the air domain was quite palpable.”"
"WASHINGTON — President Trump undercut his own secretary of state on Sunday, calling his effort to open lines of communication with North Korea a waste of time, and seeming to rule out a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear-edged confrontation with Pyongyang.A day after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said he was reaching out to Pyongyang in hopes of starting a new dialogue, Mr. Trump belittled the idea and left the impression that he was focused mainly on military options. Mr. Trump was privately described by advisers as furious at Mr. Tillerson for contradicting the president’s public position that now is not the time for talks.“I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, using the derogatory nickname he has assigned to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. “Save your energy Rex,” he added, “we’ll do what has to be done!”While some analysts wondered if the president was intentionally playing bad cop to the secretary’s good cop, veteran diplomats said they could not remember a time when a president undermined his secretary of state so brazenly in the midst of a tense situation, and the episode raised fresh questions about how long Mr. Tillerson would remain in his job.A former chief executive of Exxon Mobil with no prior government experience, Mr. Tillerson has been deeply frustrated and has told associates that he tries to ignore the president’s Twitter blasts. But these would be hard to disregard as Mr. Tillerson returned from China, where he was trying to enlist more support from North Korea’s primary trading partner and political patron.“It may be intended as a good-cop, bad-cop strategy, but the tweet is so over the top that it undercuts Tillerson,” said Sue Mi Terry, a former Korea analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Council. “It’s hard to imagine any other president speaking in this manner.”Christopher R. Hill, who under President George W. Bush was the last American negotiator to reach a significant agreement with North Korea, said, “Clearly, it is part of his management style, which seems to be to undermine his people at every turn.” While Mr. Hill took issue with the way Mr. Tillerson handled his disclosure in Beijing on Saturday, “Trump’s tweet undermines Tillerson’s visit, leaving his interlocutors wondering why they are wasting the time to speak with him.”But Michael Green, who was Mr. Bush’s chief Asia adviser, said the time was not ripe yet for talks. “The president is right on this one in the sense that Pyongyang is clear it will not put nuclear weapons on the negotiating table, nor will the current level of sanctions likely convince them to do so, though an effective sanctions regime might in time,” he said.Indeed, several hours after his initial tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to preclude the possibility that the time might ever be ripe, without laying out his own preferred strategy. “Being nice to Rocket Man hasn’t worked in 25 years, why would it work now?” he wrote, evidently referring not just to Mr. Kim, who took over six years ago, but also his father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder. “Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won’t fail.”North Korea has provoked a conflict with the United States and its Asian allies in recent weeks with its sixth test of a nuclear bomb and its first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially deliver a warhead to the United States mainland. Mr. Trump has responded by vowing to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend the United States or its allies, while ratcheting up economic pressure through sanctions.Mr. Tillerson told reporters traveling with him in Beijing on Saturday that he was seeking a diplomatic solution. “We are probing, so stay tuned,” he said. For the first time, he disclosed that the United States had two or three channels to Pyongyang asking “Would you like to talk?” Therefore, he said, “we’re not in a dark situation, a blackout.”There have been no indications that Mr. Kim is any more interested in talks than Mr. Trump. He has responded to the president’s threats with more of his own, castigating Mr. Trump as a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” and suggesting through his foreign minister that he might order the first atmospheric nuclear test the world has seen in 37 years.Negotiations with North Korea have long proved frustrating to American leaders. Mr. Bush and President Bill Clinton both tried talks and granted concessions while ultimately failing to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. But national security analysts have said there is no viable military option at this point without risking devastating casualties.White House officials made no official comment on Mr. Tillerson’s disclosure or Mr. Trump’s reaction, but advisers privately said the president was upset at being caught off guard. At the same time, they did not rule out diplomacy as a possible path forward eventually. On the campaign trail last year, Mr. Trump expressed a willingness to negotiate with Mr. Kim over a hamburger. He plans to visit China, South Korea and Japan in November, among other destinations, to keep up regional pressure on Pyongyang.Despite the president’s message, Mr. Tillerson’s spokeswoman said diplomacy remained possible. “#DPRK will not obtain a nuclear capability,” Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, wrote on Twitter after Mr. Trump’s tweet, using initials for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “Diplomatic channels are open for #KimJongUn for now. They won’t be open forever.” She did not explain what she meant about not obtaining a nuclear capability, which North Korea already has.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States had no choice but to seek a diplomatic agreement.“I think that there’s more going on than meets the eye,” he said on “Meet the Press” on NBC before the president’s tweets. “I think Tillerson understands that every intelligence agency we have says there’s no amount of economic pressure you can put on North Korea to get them to stop this program because they view this as their survival.”While advisers said Mr. Trump’s comments were born out of aggravation at Mr. Tillerson, he could be attempting his own version of Richard M. Nixon’s “madman” theory, casting himself as trigger-happy to bolster the bargaining power of his aides. Mr. Trump has often talked about the value of seeming willing to pull out of agreements like the Iran nuclear deal, South Korea free trade pact and Paris climate accords, to stake out a position in negotiations.But this is qualitatively different. A misreading of North Korea could result in an atmospheric nuclear test or an artillery barrage against Seoul, the South Korean capital. Mr. Kim likes to play madman as well. Yet he has little incentive to begin talks now and may be betting that in the end the Trump administration would settle for a freeze in testing, leaving him with a medium-size nuclear force that serves his purposes.North Korea has divided administrations over strategy before. When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in 2001 that the new Bush administration would continue Mr. Clinton’s approach, Mr. Bush angrily called Condoleezza Rice, his national security adviser, and instructed her to tell the secretary to correct himself. Mr. Powell then publicly fell on his sword and said he had gotten “too far forward” on his skis. When Mr. Bush was ready for negotiations in his second term, Mr. Hill found persistent resistance from Vice President Dick Cheney.But none encountered the sort of public contradiction from the president that Mr. Tillerson did. Mr. Trump has made clear he does not mind publicly breaking with cabinet secretaries, as he did last summer when he castigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions as “very weak.” And he has contradicted Mr. Tillerson before as well, launching a harsh broadside against the Persian Gulf state of Qatar barely an hour after the secretary of state called for a “calm and thoughtful dialogue.”Mr. Tillerson’s comments in Beijing on Saturday night did not appear spontaneous. After hours in the Great Hall of the People, where he met separately with China’s foreign minister, state councilor and then President Xi Jinping, he sat down with a group of American reporters in the living room of the home of the American ambassador, Terry Branstad.He appeared relaxed, though tired after more than a day of travel, and was forthright, if typically brief, about his efforts to lower the temperature between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim and open a diplomatic channel.He volunteered that there had been “direct contact” with North Korea and emphasized the point several times. His comment seemed surprising because just days before, speaking at a conference in Washington, the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, had said there had been no diplomatic contact, and that if it began “hopefully it will not make it into The New York Times.”"
"WASHINGTON — As Democrats warily prepare to negotiate an immigration deal with President Trump, they face an unexpected political foe: many of the 800,000 young, undocumented immigrants threatened with deportation whom they are championing.The pressure from some immigrant activists to reject any compromise that would tighten border security has frustrated Democratic leaders, who recognize the political risks of being labeled the party of open borders — a potentially lethal tag as they seek to regain support from working-class voters across the Midwest.Fearful of concessions to Mr. Trump that could increase immigration enforcement aimed at their families and friends, the activists are targeting Democratic congressional leaders with loud political protests. And Democratic politicians may be vulnerable. They have already shifted to the left on a number of issues, such as health care, as they try to take advantage of liberal fervor stoked by the Trump era.But moving too far to the left on border security could hold serious risks for a party that lost the presidency with defeats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa — all states where immigration remains a hot-button issue.John Feehery, a Republican strategist, said a Democratic pushback on border security would reinforce “the perception that the Democratic Party has largely abandoned and forgotten about the white working class.”So far, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leaders, are staying pragmatic, even in the face of protests that have been personal and cutting. (Activists called Ms. Pelosi a liar in San Francisco.)They have already signaled that they are willing to consider Republican demands for increased enforcement along the border with Mexico in exchange for a legislative fix to the threatened Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which protects young immigrants brought to the country as children.“It is naïve for us to believe that we will get 12 Republicans to vote for DACA or the Dream Act without putting something on the table,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, an co-author of the Dream Act, which would offer a path to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. “There’s always going to be a group that wants more. There are some people who want all or nothing.”Democrats need to be mindful not just of white working-class voters but all voters, said Cornell Belcher, who worked as one of President Barack Obama’s pollsters during his 2008 presidential campaign. Democrats have to “thread a fine needle,” he said, because polls show that voters broadly “feel as though their borders need to be more secure.”But activists worry that any compromise could carry a very personal price: Their own long-term safety might be secured only in exchange for an increased threat of deportation for their undocumented parents and friends who do not qualify for such protections under the program.That is a deal that many of them are not willing to take.“We are going to do whatever it takes to push both parties to pursue what we are demanding,” said Cristina Jiménez, executive director of United We Dream. “We don’t want a situation where my brother, who has DACA, will have relief from deportation, and we will have more enforcement and more ICE agents who end up going after my mom and my dad.”The prospect of a strange-bedfellows deal on one of the most contentious political issues of the last two decades emerged last month after Mr. Trump and the two Democrats dined at the White House. The working dinner set the stage for an end-of-the-year clash in Congress over border security, limits on immigration and the fate of the young immigrants known as “Dreamers.”Mr. Trump had announced an end to his predecessor’s program before the dinner, but his willingness to pursue a bipartisan legislative deal to enshrine the program into law set off a furious response from conservatives on television news programs that the president is known to watch.That has made the legislative path forward far from certain.Mr. Trump is under pressure from inside and outside his administration to insist on an array of tough immigration control measures in exchange for what his supporters view as “amnesty” for the undocumented immigrants. Administration officials say he will soon release a set of principles that will guide his deal-making with the Democrats.Conservatives want those principles to include a call to limit the number of new legal immigrants and emphasize the entry of high-skilled workers instead of the family members of immigrants already in the country. They want to expand the “E-Verify” system to ensure that businesses do not hire undocumented workers. They are insisting on stepped-up immigration enforcement throughout the country’s interior. And they want Mr. Trump to get his wall along the southern border.Immigration activists reject such demands as meanspirited and too far-reaching. Previous legislative efforts during the administrations of George W. Bush and Mr. Obama considered that breadth of immigration enforcement, but only in exchange for a path to citizenship for all 12 million of the undocumented immigrants in the country, not the smaller pool of so-called Dreamers.Those young immigrants and their allies say they will not accept what they consider draconian measures in exchange for a deal on DACA, or on the Dream Act, the bill dating back to 2001 that would provide a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants brought in illegally as children.“I think Senator Schumer crumbles under pressure just so he can deliver on something,” said Cesar Adrian Vargas, an immigrant-rights advocate and a DACA recipient.But the larger constellation of immigrant-rights groups are divided.Veteran activists view the no-compromise strategy as shortsighted and unlikely to succeed. While few said they were willing to work directly with Mr. Trump the way they worked with Mr. Bush during past immigration fights, they also said they recognized the need to compromise.Janet Murguía, president of UnidosUS, formerly the National Council of La Raza, said that she understood that Mr. Trump would need to be part of the deal, but that she cringed at the thought of ever reaching out to a president who kicked off his campaign by claiming that Mexican immigrants were “rapists” and “criminals” and who often told crowds across the Midwest that immigrants threatened their jobs.“I don’t think someone who is literally throwing rocks at you and demonizing you can have credibility at the table to say they want to engage,” Ms. Murguía said.White House officials have not been on strategy conference calls organized by the immigration groups, as some of Mr. Bush’s aides were during the legislative efforts to pass an immigration overhaul in 2006 and 2007. But immigration activists and lawmakers who went through those unsuccessful fights said they could not win without compromising.That drama is likely to play out at the end of the year as lawmakers in both parties face a mid-December deadline to fund the government and extend some popular initiatives like the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The expectation is that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will allow the immigration issue to be settled as part of the budget deal.If that happens, some immigration rights activists say Democrats will have no choice but to accept some Republican demands in exchange for legalizing the young immigrants.Democrats also must weigh the political risk of being seen as weak on security issues as they try to recover from their 2016 losses.During the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual conference last month, Kathleen Wells, a black radio host, challenged several members of Congress to explain why black Americans should embrace allowing more immigrants to remain in the United States who might compete with them for jobs. Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California, responded by saying it was critically important that blacks and other minorities not allow themselves to be “divided and pitted against each other.”Shortly after protesters interrupted a news conference she was holding in San Francisco last month, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that she understood the activists’ frustration, but said they were “completely wrong.”“We are determined to get Republicans votes to pass the clean Dream Act,” she said. “Is it possible to pass a bill without some border security? Well, we’ll have to see.”"
"America, Megyn Kelly would like you to know that she’s “kind of done with politics now.”That declaration is the funniest part of “Megyn Kelly Today.” After all, Ms. Kelly’s work covering politics on Fox News is a big reason she’s hosting a morning show on NBC — where, just months ago, she was interviewing Vladimir V. Putin and the “InfoWars” conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in prime time. Maybe she’s just done with politics before noon.But also, the first week of “Megyn Kelly Today” most closely resembled a familiar political ritual: an awkward rebranding campaign by handlers trying to humanize their candidate.Ms. Kelly’s opening shows were filled with photo-op moments that screamed, “I am a relatable person who enjoys human fun!” She flipped eggs in an omelet pan, like a pol tossing flapjacks at an Iowa fair. She danced with “Today” show fans. She petted a dog. She was surprised by her colleagues with a cart of mimosas. “O.M.G.,” she said, as if reading an eye chart.Much like a nominee’s bio reel at a convention, the show brought out personal history and validators’ testimony. She reminisced about her father, who died when she was a teenager. Family members described her, in the words of her stepsister, Liza Kirwan, as “a fun-loving, intelligent crazy person.”She might be. We can’t know Ms. Kelly’s private self, only the one she projects on TV. On Fox, the onetime lawyer had a crisp, courtroom manner, and her tenacious debate questioning drew sexist attacks from Donald J. Trump. On NBC daytime, she seems as if she learned to engage an audience by reading a briefing book.This has involved a lot of telling rather than showing. She told us how much she loves “Will & Grace” (one of many NBC properties plugged on the show) and how much she hates seeing “perfect” models on magazine covers at the supermarket “just as I’m loading up with a bunch of Ben & Jerry’s.” Before a segment about the babies of drug-addicted mothers, she conveyed the depth of its emotion by saying, “Let me tell you: tears.”She also promised a politics-free zone, to the point of strangely downplaying the stridently anti-Trump tone of the “Will & Grace” premiere in front of the show’s own cast.The idea that TV fans just want an escape from partisan fighting is intuitive, but it’s not necessarily borne out by evidence. Jimmy Kimmel, the mostly apolitical late-night host, just took a rare lead in the ratings after he went on the health care warpath. Viewers may be sick of politics in the Trump era, but that doesn’t mean they’re tired of it.So two days in a row, studio audience members asked Ms. Kelly what she thought of N.F.L. players kneeling to protest racism during the national anthem. And two days in a row, she gave the same noncommittal answer, almost verbatim: “Those players have every right to take a knee, and those who object to it have every right to say they object.” In conclusion: “Go USA!” (Welcome to 2017, when Miss Texas has a stronger take than a former Fox host.)Ms. Kelly’s can’t-we-all-get-along stance is pretty rich, considering that she made her name in the trenches of Fox News’s culture war, insisting in a 2013 segment that Jesus and Santa Claus were white. This week, she told a gay “Will & Grace” fan from the audience that “the gay thing’s gonna work out” for him, after which the sitcom’s co-star Debra Messing said she regretted having appeared on the show.But if we take Ms. Kelly as sincere, this still means the entire argument for her show is that she’s burned out on the politics thing and needs a break. That’s fine for her, and maybe a wise self-care decision. But it does not create an obligation on the audience’s part.With “Megyn Kelly Today” defined mainly as what it isn’t, what’s left is an odd hybrid of morning escape and nightly newsmagazine. Ms. Kelly seemed more at home in a Friday segment on O. J. Simpson’s impending release from prison than in an interview with Robert Redford and Jane Fonda, derailed by her record-scratch of a question to Ms. Fonda about cosmetic surgery.Ms. Kelly was most animated and passionate on the challenges for women in the work force. She advised young women to work hard and uncomplainingly but added, “You’ve got to know where to draw the line if someone’s behaving inappropriately.” It was hard not to recall that she was one of several women whose complaints of sexual harassment helped oust the Fox News chief executive, Roger Ailes.She also showed flashes of a dry, deadpan humor. But “Megyn Kelly Today” is following a daytime template of escape, uplift and inspiration in which it doesn’t fit.This leaves Ms. Kelly talking a lot about “joy,” a word, as my colleague John Koblin noted in a feature about her, she’s particularly fond of. In her opening speech, she vowed to have “more joy in my life”; in an interview with the convicted killer Lyle Menendez (the subject of a new NBC “Law & Order” series) she asked if he has any joy in his.“Joy” has become one of those self-actualization words that takes everyday emotion — happiness, fun, love — and both elevates and guts it, turning it into an achievement, an accreditation, something you might give a TED Talk about. In that sense, “Megyn Kelly Today” is full of joy. It’s just not enjoyable."
"WASHINGTON — Washington could soon bypass Portland, Ore., as the American city with the highest share of bicycle commuters, due in part to growing competition among bike-borrowing programs, according to census data and cycling enthusiasts.Five companies are vying for real estate in the capital’s bike-share market, offering GPS-tracked bikes that lock themselves without a central kiosk. The newest bike-share offering — Jump, which arrived last Monday — uses an electric motor to bolster manual pedaling, so riders do not have to break a sweat.But while the city embraces its innovative bicycling culture, longtime riders argue that the capital still lacks infrastructure to support it. With almost 17,000 bicycle commuters in 2016, the city is facing ever-greater urgency to ensure commuter safety.Transportation planners in the capital are in a bind. Commuters from the surrounding suburbs almost double Washington’s daytime population to one million people, and subway delays, car accidents and motorcades are a source of regular gridlock.Washington became the nation’s testing ground for bike-sharing programs with the 2008 introduction of SmartBike DC, a modest venture that began with 10 rental kiosks. Its successor, Capital Bikeshare, currently operates almost 500 docks. Three new programs — Mobike, LimeBike and Spin — don’t require any: A frame-mounted lock immobilizes the bicycle until a rider scans a bar code with a smartphone camera to activate it. When finished with a trip, the rider can leave the bike anywhere legal.But critics worry most about beginner urban riders navigating the segmented nature of the city’s designated bicycle lanes: They begin and end seemingly at random, forcing cyclists to veer into four-lane roads stippled with potholes and urban grit. Buses and hurried automobile traffic push them into the right-most lane, where doors of parked cars can swing open unexpectedly, catapulting cyclists.“I take the least intrusive route possible, and I still can’t prevent getting ‘doored,’ ” said Marcus Greenberg, a bicycle commuter of four years, lamenting that drivers curse him onto the sidewalks while pedestrians curse him onto the roads. “Without a bike lane, you’re the minority — everybody hates you. You flip over your handlebars, and the driver wants you to pay for the dent your head made in their Prius.”One barrier to consistent bike lanes is what riders call “bikelash,” or local resistance to bicycle lane installation when it threatens parking availability. In 2015, when the city considered installing four blocks of bike lanes in eastern portions of downtown, nearby church congregants protested in such large numbers that a Department of Transportation meeting was dispersed due to a violation of the fire code.Another barrier is the prioritization of “levels of service,” an engineering measurement for the rate at which a motor vehicle can be moved through an urban intersection to minimize congestion. Such was the case on Grant Circle in northwest Washington, where a recent plan to install a protected bike lane was scratched because it would have narrowed the motor vehicle path to one lane from two.“In urban bicycle route planning, the joke is: We can do absolutely anything we want — as long as it doesn’t inconvenience a single driver in a single place for a single second,” said David Cranor, chairman of the D.C. Bicycle Advisory Council to the government.Critics argue that both priorities are shortsighted and overlook the city’s long-range plan for decreasing urban congestion: getting more citizens on bikes.In several European cities — where bike-sharing programs date from the 1960s — biking incentives are programmed right into the traffic signals. Automated “green waves” allow bicyclists — who have their own well-marked lanes and traffic lights — to maintain a pace of about 12 miles per hour without encountering red lights, despite traffic controls on car lanes. In these cycle-friendly cities, even in the most inclement weather most bike lanes must be plowed before motor vehicle ones.“We’d like to see this city be much braver about saying to people, ‘Look, this is the most sustainable transportation plan,’ ” said Tamara Evans, the advocacy director at the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. “ ‘It’s cleaner, it’s healthier, and we’re just going to build this.’ ”According to the district’s Department of Transportation, that strategy is difficult in practice.“It is definitely a balancing act,” said Jim Sebastian, the local Department of Transportation’s associate director for planning and sustainability, who previously worked as a bicycle coordinator in the government. “There’s a finite amount of space in the city, and we need to think about all of the modes.”The department emphasized the progressiveness of the pilot programs. New York, which has Citi Bike, and Chicago, which has Divvy, both public-private partnerships similar to Capital Bikeshare, have yet to welcome dockless competitors.One of Washington’s new programs, Spin, recently withdrew plans for a New York rollout after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the mayor. If the new Washington bike programs catch on, the capital’s share of commuters who cycle — it was 4.6 percent in 2016, according to Census Bureau data — could bypass Portland’s 6.3 percent.One constituency has long been optimistic that an increase in bicyclists could catalyze sophisticated infrastructure. D.C. Bike Party — a monthly tradition in which costumed riders weave in unison through the city, toward a designated bar — already draws several hundred bike-share riders each month.“In a snarled-up city, this will always be a place of solidarity for the bicyclists — the lawyers, the bike messengers, the moms and dads,” said Lia Seremetis, the group’s founder."
"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, which was short-handed and slumbering for more than a year after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, is returning to the bench on Monday with a far-reaching docket that renews its central role in American life.The new term is studded with major cases likely to provoke sharp conflicts. One of them, on political gerrymandering, has the potential to reshape American politics. Another may settle the question of whether businesses can turn away patrons like gay couples in the name of religious freedom.The court will hear important workers’ rights cases, including one on employers’ power to prevent workers from banding together to sue them. Perhaps the most consequential case involves fundamental principles of privacy in an age when cellphones record our every move.“There’s only one prediction that’s entirely safe about the upcoming term,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said last month at Georgetown’s law school. “It will be momentous.”The court returned to full strength in April when Justice Neil M. Gorsuch replaced Justice Scalia after a fight over the seat that lasted more than a year. In the few cases in which Justice Gorsuch participated in the last term, most of them minor, he consistently voted with the court’s most conservative members, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.Justice Gorsuch’s first full term, which will include more than the usual number of blockbusters, will bring his jurisprudence into sharper focus.At the same time, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is likely to decide closely divided cases as the member of the court at its ideological center, has been drifting left. According to data compiled by Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Justice Kennedy’s voting in the term in which Justice Scalia died, ending last year, was the most liberal of any justice in that decisive central position since the mid-1960s.Justice Kennedy is 81, and he has signaled that he is considering retirement. Should President Trump name his replacement, the court would almost certainly gain a justice ideologically similar to Justice Gorsuch, leaving it with a solidly conservative majority and thrusting Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. into the median position.The court’s docket may be an embarrassment of riches, but it is also a work in progress. The justices have for now  set aside arguments over Mr. Trump’s travel ban while they consider whether the administration’s issuing of a new travel order has made the current challenge moot. And there are major cases on the horizon, including one on whether a federal employment discrimination law protects gay men and lesbians.“The upcoming term,” said Elizabeth Slattery, a lawyer with the Heritage Foundation, “promises to be one for the history books.”Justice Ginsburg has singled out one case in the coming term as especially important: Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, which could change the way elections are conducted. Speaking in July at a Duke Law School event, Justice Ginsburg said the court’s decision to hear the case was “perhaps the most important grant so far.”The challengers in the case, which will be argued Tuesday, are asking the court to rule for the first time that extreme political gerrymandering — the drawing of voting districts to give lopsided advantages to the party in power — violates the Constitution.Few think partisan gerrymandering is an attractive feature of American democracy. But the Supreme Court has so far never struck down a voting map on the ground that politics played too large a role in how it was drawn.The decisive vote probably belongs to Justice Kennedy, who has expressed uneasiness about partisan gerrymandering. In 2004, he wrote that he might consider a challenge to the practice if there were “a workable standard” to decide when such tactics crossed a constitutional line.The challengers in the new case, Democratic voters in Wisconsin, say that they have identified such a standard and that the maps drawn by Republican lawmakers in the state after the 2010 census badly fail it. In a surprising move, several prominent Republicans filed briefs in the Supreme Court saying the same thing.The Supreme Court will hear a second case on voting rights in November, that one concerning the lawfulness of Ohio’s vigorous efforts to cull its voting rolls.Federal laws generally prohibit states from removing people from the rolls “by reason of the person’s failure to vote.” Ohio sends confirmation notices to people who fail to vote over a two-year period and then removes them from the rolls if they do not respond and do not vote in the next four years.Before the appeals court, the Obama administration argued that the state had gone further than the law allowed. In an unusual move, the Trump administration switched sides in the case, Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, No. 16-980, telling the Supreme Court that the relevant laws allowed Ohio to purge its voter rolls.The court will re-enter the culture wars in a case concerning a Colorado baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a gay couple, saying it would violate his Christian faith and his right to free speech.The case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, No. 16-111, involves a clash between laws that prohibit businesses open to the public from discriminating based on sexual orientation and claims of religious freedom.On one side are religious people and companies that say the government should not force them to choose between the requirements of their faiths and their livelihoods. On the other are gay and lesbian couples who say they are entitled to equal treatment from businesses that choose to serve the general public.The Supreme Court’s earlier decisions and Justice Kennedy’s conflicting impulses about gay rights and free speech make the outcome hard to predict. In 2015, in a majority opinion written by Justice Kennedy, the court established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and the court has in recent decades consistently ruled in favor of gay rights.But the court has also shown solicitude for businesses run on religious principles, as when it ruled in 2014 that some companies could not be required to provide free contraceptive coverage for their female workers. Justice Kennedy voted with the majority.On Monday, the court will hear arguments about whether companies can use arbitration clauses in employment contracts to prohibit workers from linking together to take legal action over workplace issues.The Supreme Court has generally favored contracts that require disputes to be resolved informally through arbitration rather than litigation. In cases concerning consumer contracts, like the standard-form agreements used by cellphone and car rental companies, the court has also endorsed class-action waivers in arbitration provisions.The question for the justices in three new cases, including Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, No. 16-258, is whether the same principles apply to employment contracts.The workers in the cases say employment contracts are different from consumer contracts because the National Labor Relations Act protects “concerted activities” by workers. That language, they say, prohibits class-action waivers.As in the Ohio case on voter rolls, the federal government has switched sides in the arbitration cases. The Obama administration had supported the workers; the Trump administration will argue on behalf of the employers.On Thursday, the court agreed to hear a second major case on workers’ rights, one that could deal a sharp blow to public-sector unions. The court deadlocked on the issue in the case after Justice Scalia’s death. Now that it is back to full strength, unions have reason to be nervous.The question in the case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, No. 16-1466, is whether government workers who choose not to join unions may be forced to pay for the unions’ collective bargaining work.If the court rules against the unions, millions of government workers in more than 20 states could be allowed to opt out of paying for collective bargaining, depriving unions of vast sums of money and making them less powerful and effective.A leading candidate for the most important case of the term is Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402, which will consider the privacy of location data held by cellphone companies.“This is the most consequential case currently on the court’s docket,” said Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer with Williams & Connolly. Nathan Freed Wessler, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said, “This is the most important Fourth Amendment case we’ve seen in a generation.”The A.C.L.U. represents Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted in a series of robberies based in part on records provided by his cellular carrier that showed his movements over several months. Mr. Carpenter said that prosecutors’ failure to obtain a warrant for the information violated the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches and seizures.Earlier Supreme Court decisions should give Mr. Carpenter reasons for optimism. The court has limited the government’s ability to use GPS devices to track people’s movements, and it has required a warrant to search cellphones.A ruling in his favor could revise a fundamental Fourth Amendment principle: that people have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they voluntarily turn over information to a third party like a phone company."
"WASHINGTON — Almost from the moment that Islamist militants overran the American consulate and assaulted a C.I.A. annex in Benghazi, Libya, in September 2012, politics consumed the deadly attacks. Using the event as partisan ammunition, Republicans and conservative media outlets sought to make the city’s name synonymous with Democratic scandal.But beginning on Monday in a federal courthouse in Washington, prosecutors will put forward an account that focuses not on politics, but squarely on the attacks themselves and a man they say bears direct responsibility: Ahmed Abu Khattala.“The Benghazi case has been burdened with a lot of politics; now it is the turn of law enforcement, national security professionals and prosecutors to show the world what really happened,” said Carlos T. Fernandez, a former senior F.B.I. counterterrorism official whose agents investigated the attacks.The trial will serve as the latest test of the civilian court system’s ability to handle foreign terrorism suspects captured by Special Operations commandos under battlefield conditions, rather than subjecting them to military detention and prosecution.Prosecutors are expected to portray Mr. Khatalla as a ringleader of a local militia of Islamic extremists who was angry about the American presence in Benghazi and played a leading role in directing the attacks. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was killed, as were three other Americans: Sean Smith, a State Department information officer, and two C.I.A. operatives, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. Mr. Stevens, who died of smoke inhalation, was the first American ambassador killed in an attack since 1979.During the attacks, militants wielding machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades breached the walls and set fire to the consulate, then used mortars in an attack on the C.I.A. base about a mile away. Later, Mr. Khatalla gave interviews to Western journalists, acknowledging that he was at the consulate but denying involvement in the violence.Even though he was widely known to be a primary suspect, he made no attempt to flee Benghazi. He was later captured, interrogated for days aboard the warship New York as it steamed across the ocean, then charged with multiple counts, including murder, destruction of federal buildings and providing support to terrorism. His trial is expected to take about five weeks, and include surveillance video clips and eyewitness testimony reconstructing the attacks, the role he is accused of playing and his eventual capture.Mr. Khatalla, who faces a potential sentence of life in prison if convicted, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers will most likely try to cast suspicion on others who were at the consulate that night to deflect blame from their client. The Justice Department has charged at least a dozen people under seal in the attacks, officials say.The attacks crystallized Libya’s descent into chaos after the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, which, with help from NATO air power, had toppled the country’s longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Conservatives focused on such issues as why early Obama administration talking points inaccurately portrayed the attacks as a spontaneous protest rather than a premeditated assault. In time, the Benghazi attacks came to serve as shorthand for failures by Hillary Clinton, then the nation’s top diplomat, and President Barack Obama. Congress conducted multiple oversight investigations into Benghazi, including an inquiry by a House select committee that questioned Mrs. Clinton for 11 hours of public testimony about such topics as her use of a private email server while secretary of state.Mr. Khatalla’s trial will be closely watched, not only because of the notoriety of the attacks — Hollywood dramatized them in the film “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi” — but also for its implications for national security legal policy. The case is a particularly high-profile instance of using civilian court to prosecute a foreign terrorism suspect captured abroad.A recurring debate has emerged over whether such suspects should instead be held and interrogated at the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, then prosecuted before the military commissions system there.“There are dozens upon dozens of terrorism-related cases, but every now and then there is one that has the potential to reframe how people think about the efficacy of civilian prosecution,” said Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor who specializes in national security. “This has all the hallmarks of such a case.”In June 2014, the military launched its operation — code-named Greenbrier River, according to former military officials — to snatch Mr. Khattala. With the help of an informant, he was lured to a small villa on the coastline of Libya, an ideal spot to ambush him because of its isolation. As he stepped into the house, a team of operators from the Army’s elite Delta Force and an agent from the F.B.I.’s hostage rescue team rushed to grab him.Mr. Khattala, who had a handgun, resisted for several minutes — kicking and punching furiously — but was quickly subdued and handcuffed, according to court records. He was outfitted with earmuffs, blindfolded and gagged. He was then taken to the beach, where Navy SEALs whisked him on a boat to an American warship. Before reaching the vessel, Mr. Khattala repeatedly asked his captors: “Why me? Why me?”On board, Mr. Khattala received three staples to the top of his head because of an injury he suffered during the capture.Mr. Khatalla’s detention facility aboard the ship consisted of four roughly 8-foot cubes and a toilet. The lights were kept on 24 hours a day for security reasons. During the 13-day voyage across the ocean, Mr. Khatalla was interrogated for five days without being advised of his so-called Miranda rights to remain silent or consult with a defense lawyer. Then, after a two-day break, new interrogators from the F.B.I. delivered the Miranda warning and questioned him again.Mr. Khatalla waived his rights and continued to talk to the new team, and prosecutors intend to use what he said to them as evidence against him. His defense lawyers later said that his waiver should not count because he was still under coercive circumstances, but the judge presiding over the case, Christopher Cooper, rejected the defense motion to suppress those statements, ruling that the waiver was voluntary and allowing the evidence to be used.For prosecutors, the ruling cleared their biggest potential obstacle to a conviction in civilian court.Republicans criticized the Obama administration for putting Mr. Khattala in the criminal justice system after his capture, rather than taking him to Guantánamo, at least for a more prolonged interrogation without a Miranda warning and defense lawyer.Still, it is not clear that Mr. Khatalla would have been eligible for a war crimes trial; even though he shares the ideology of Al Qaeda, an organization with which the United States is at war, he is not believed to have meaningful links to that organization.Adding to the complexity of the case, the F.B.I. was not able to swiftly secure the crime scene and conduct a typical forensic investigation because Benghazi was too dangerous.The trial also comes as the Trump administration is weighing what to do with an American citizen accused of fighting for the Islamic State before surrendering to a Syrian militia around Sept. 12.The militia handed the prisoner over to the American military. The Pentagon has not revealed the detainee’s name or location, but the International Committee for the Red Cross and the Defense Department acknowledged last week that the United States had provided a formal notice and was arranging for a visit by the humanitarian group.The law governing military commissions at the wartime prison at Guantánamo precludes American citizens from being tried in that system, and it is disputed whether Islamic State detainees, as opposed to members of Al Qaeda, may be lawfully held there in indefinite detention without trial.Although Mr. Khatalla is not an American citizen, the Obama administration chose not to send him to Guantánamo both because it was trying to close the prison and because he lacked strong ties to Al Qaeda.A jury trial in a terrorism case nonetheless carries risk. In the 2010 trial of Ahmed Ghailani, a former Guantánamo detainee charged with Al Qaeda’s 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa, he was convicted of conspiring to destroy American buildings but acquitted of 284 other charges, including every murder count.Even though the case qualified as a victory for the prosecution — the single conviction was enough for the judge to impose a life sentence — critics of using civilian trials for terrorism cases portrayed the result as a disaster.Invoking the Ghailani case, Mr. Chesney said of Mr. Khattala’s trial, “If it were to go wrong in some way for the government, it will certainly be seized upon by critics of the criminal justice process as a tool for counterterrorism — notwithstanding the endless number of successful Justice Department terrorism prosecutions that have already occurred.”"
"WASHINGTON — On the first crisp fall day in Washington, thousands of anti-racism marchers proved that the capital’s summer of protests had not yet come to a close.Two separate rallies — the March for Racial Justice and the March for Black Women — converged in Lincoln Park, a picnic-and-birthday-party plot nestled in the heart of the gentrified eastern part of the Capitol Hill neighborhood. They marched in front of the Justice Department before descending on the National Mall to denounce institutionalized racism.“It’s now an Injustice Department,” said Markus Batchelor, a member of Washington’s State Board of Education representing Ward 8, a predominantly black part of the city where he was raised. “We’re here because there are concerted efforts to deprive minorities of their rights. Under this president, the Justice Department has become a mechanism to make injustice the law of the land — and that’s dangerous.”The March for Racial Justice — which sought to “harness the national unrest and help focus it into a national mobilization,” according to its website — was organized after the acquittal of a Minnesota police officer in the death of Philando Castile. Mr. Castile’s killing, during a traffic stop, was live-streamed on Facebook by his girlfriend.Many of Saturday’s marchers had previously been involved in protests nationwide, including the Charlottesville, Va., clashes with white nationalists. Among their demands were the removal of Confederate monuments, deeper legal investigations into hate crimes, and greater focus on indigenous cultures, colonialism and slavery in textbooks. Throughout the weekend, more than 15 related marches were scheduled to take place around the country.The March for Black Women — organized to bring attention to the widespread incarceration of black women, sexual violence and murders of black transgender people — aimed to set itself apart from the huge Women’s March on Washington in January, after Inauguration Day, which received some criticism for a perceived focus on white women’s activism.“Look around, look at the ways you black women show up to a march,” Michaela Angela Davis, a fashion and race writer and activist, said from the rally stage. “Braids, Afro-pops — y’all can’t fit that under a pink hat.”The group held a morning rally of several hundred black women and allies before joining the racial justice protesters. Women linked arms as speakers recited the names of black female victims of violence, punctuated by a chant of “Say her name!”Though much smaller, the women’s march did not accidentally overlap with the main rally.“I heard about the March for Racial Justice, and I didn’t think there would be space for black women,” said Farah Tanis, a founder of the group Black Women’s Blueprint and an organizer of the march.But one week after President Trump sparked a national debate over N.F.L. players’ kneeling protest during the national anthem, the two events began together. Led by beating drums, protesters jabbed signs in the air: “Complacent is complicit!”; “Melanin rocks!”; “It’s so bad that even introverts are here.”Iris Jacob, the founder of Social Justice Synergy, a local justice and inclusion training organization, came to the marches with her two daughters.“I brought them because I thought about myself as a little girl, and how this kind of event would have changed my life,” she said, cradling one of them against her chest.The weekend coincided with the anniversary of the three-day massacre in Elaine, Ark., at which over 100 black activists were killed after organizing to pursue fairer wages on white-owned plantations at the conclusion of the so-called Red Summer of 1919.“This isn’t new — it’s always been relevant,” said Sade Moonsammy, a marcher and friend of Ms. Jacob’s. “We aren’t asking for anything that our parents haven’t already asked for. We’re still in the fight.”"
"President Trump’s criticism of the mayor of San Juan, P.R., drew sharp rebukes across social media on Saturday, including from Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator and original star of “Hamilton.”Mr. Miranda, who has family in Puerto Rico and is raising money for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, said the president was “going straight to hell.”Mr. Trump lashed out at Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of the Puerto Rican capital, in a series of tweets on Saturday morning, one day after she appeared on television and described in stark terms the dire conditions on the island. The president accused Ms. Cruz of “poor leadership” and implied that Puerto Ricans were relying too heavily on the federal government, adding that they “want everything to be done for them.”Ms. Cruz responded to Mr. Trump’s comments in an interview on MSNBC, saying: “I was asking for help. I wasn’t saying anything nasty about the president.”She added: “This is a time when everyone shows their true colors. I have no time for distractions. All I have is time for people to move forward, get help.”Mr. Miranda defended Ms. Cruz and suggested the president was lying about the effectiveness of the federal response. He also took aim at Mr. Trump for spending the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.While it is not unusual for celebrities to criticize Mr. Trump on Twitter, the remarks were particularly searing, and they came as a major dispute was unfolding over whether the federal government was doing enough to help Puerto Rico, an American commonwealth with 3.4 million citizens.The governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, has called Hurricane Maria the “greatest catastrophe” in the island’s modern history. Officials have struggled to distribute supplies and many residents are still without power, food and water.“Puerto Ricans need supplies and resources just as badly as their fellow Americans in Texas and Florida,” Mr. Miranda wrote in a recent column for The Hollywood Reporter. “This need is magnified by their geographic isolation from the mainland.”Mr. Miranda was far from the president’s only high-profile critic on Saturday, as actors, singers and politicians expressed their outrage and called on Mr. Trump to do more.The comedian and television host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted at Ms. Cruz, calling her a hero.Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, drew comparisons between Mr. Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria and President George W. Bush’s actions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.“As tone deaf as George Bush’s response to Katrina was,” Mr. Himes said, “I don’t think he would have attacked the mayor from the comfort of a luxury golf club.”"
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s selection of a secretary of health and human services could be a turning point in a health care debate that has polarized Washington, as he faces a choice of working with Democrats to fix the current system or continuing his so-far failed efforts to dismantle his predecessor’s program.The resignation of Tom Price as secretary late Friday over his use of costly chartered jets capped a week of setbacks on health care for a president who made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign and his first eight months in office. Mr. Trump’s decision on a successor could be an opportunity to shift the debate, but he faces the prospect of an arduous confirmation battle.The president has sent mixed signals since the latest effort to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act collapsed in the Senate. He asserted that he had the votes to pass the repeal legislation in early 2018, while offering to negotiate with Democrats who are adamantly against it. One adviser said on Saturday that Mr. Trump was serious about compromising with Democrats and would pick a secretary who would help make that happen.Democrats urged him to pursue such a course. “Let’s get a new H.H.S. secretary who’s finally devoted to improving health care, move past these debates and come to bipartisan agreement on how to stabilize markets and make health care cheaper,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the departure of Mr. Price could begin “a new chapter for the Trump administration’s health care agenda.”The White House had no comment on Saturday, but two advisers who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters said two top candidates were Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Both have previously been vetted by the White House, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate to their current jobs within recent months, a significant selling point.Other names have been floated as well, including David Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs and a favorite of the president’s. But he has been criticized for a European trip with his wife that mixed business and sightseeing and was partially financed by taxpayers, and Mr. Trump may be reluctant to move him because he has been critical to fixing veterans’ care.Some reports floated former Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, an assistant secretary of health and human services under President George W. Bush. But he was a caustic critic of Mr. Trump during his own brief campaign for the White House that ended in late 2015 after he called the future president a “narcissist” and “egomaniacal madman.”Mr. Trump may not necessarily fill the post quickly. He has left the Department of Homeland Security in the hands of an acting secretary since John F. Kelly left in July to become White House chief of staff. The president appears to be in no rush to fill that post despite a series of hurricanes and a roiling immigration debate, issues managed by the Department of Homeland Security. He said on Friday that he would make a decision on that nomination “probably within a month.”If Mr. Trump picks Ms. Verma to succeed Mr. Price at the Department of Health and Human Services, it would be taken as a sign among many that he wants to continue vigorous opposition to the Affordable Care Act, with the government doing the minimum required by the law to implement its provisions. Ms. Verma, an ally of Vice President Mike Pence, worked closely this year with Republicans in Congress on their proposals to undo the law and to cut Medicaid, the program for more than 70 million low-income people.Still, some progressives have interpreted her work under the health care law in Indiana, where Mr. Pence was governor, to mean that while she opposed the Affordable Care Act, she was committed to finding ways to enforce it if it remained on the books.Mr. Gottlieb has more experience in Washington and was seen at the time of his appointment as the more moderate of candidates being considered. In his first months at the F.D.A., he has deftly balanced the concerns of patients and pharmaceutical companies, while taking steps to combat the opioid epidemic and speed access to lower-cost generic drugs. His nomination would be seen as a signal that the president might want to take a different approach to the health care debate.“We have the votes on the substance but not necessarily on the process, which is why we’re still confident that we can move health care forward and get it done in the spring,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said before Mr. Price’s resignation.After the latest legislative failure, Mr. Trump said he would sign an executive order in the coming week intended to enable Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, a sign that he did not intend to wait for Congress. But it is not clear that he has the authority to do that on his own, and states often resist federal efforts to intrude on their regulation of insurers.Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the panel’s ranking Democrat, have resumed negotiations on bipartisan legislation intended to shore up the current insurance exchanges and prevent prices from shooting up.The uncertainty comes at a crucial moment, just as federal and state officials are preparing for the fifth annual open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act. The open season, when people can sign up for coverage, runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15. Critics say that the Trump administration has destabilized insurance markets, driving up premiums for 2018 and making it harder for people to enroll.Mr. Price was confirmed in February by a party-line vote of 52 to 47 after giving vague, noncommittal answers about how he intended to carry out the Affordable Care Act. Confirmation of his successor could be an even sharper battle. Democrats may not have the votes to block confirmation, but they could drag out the process and make it excruciatingly difficult for the nominee and the White House.Democrats expect to press the new nominee for more specific answers to questions like these: Will the administration support bipartisan efforts to continue critically important payments to insurance companies, payments that Mr. Trump has threatened to cut off? Why has the president slashed funds for advertising, outreach and education programs and assistance to consumers who want to sign up for health insurance this fall?Neither Ms. Verma nor Mr. Gottlieb had easy confirmations to their current posts, but neither seems as strongly determined to undermine the Affordable Care Act as Mr. Price was.Ms. Verma, who earned a bachelor’s degree in life sciences at the University of Maryland and a master’s degree in public health at Johns Hopkins University, founded her own health policy consulting firm, SVC, and worked with state agencies to carry out the Affordable Care Act. Working with Mr. Pence when he was governor, she was the architect of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which expanded Medicaid under the Obama-era law.Rather than simply refusing to participate, as many Republican-led states did, Indiana under the program shaped by Ms. Verma expanded eligibility while emphasizing “personal responsibility” by requiring beneficiaries to pay premiums and contribute to health savings accounts, and giving them incentives for healthy behavior.Republicans saw that as a model for conservative enactment of the program, while Democrats criticized what they saw as roadblocks for low-income Americans. She was confirmed to her current post in March on a largely party-line 55-to-43 vote.Mr. Gottlieb, who received a bachelor’s degree in economics from Wesleyan University and a medical degree from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, served in several posts during President George W. Bush’s administration, including deputy commissioner of the F.D.A. While in the private sector, he worked as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and served as a consultant for pharmaceutical companies.Republicans said that experience would make him a formidable commissioner because he would understand the business better, while Democrats said it made him too cozy with the industry he would regulate. While a physician, Mr. Gottlieb has also experienced the industry as a patient, having been successfully treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma.After promising to divest himself from several health care companies and recuse himself for one year from decisions involving those businesses, he was confirmed in May on a 57-to-42 vote."
"WASHINGTON — The sweeping tax rewrite unveiled by President Trump and Republican lawmakers this past week leaves many of the details to Congress, but two sentences in the nine-page framework have Washington lobbyists salivating over a payday that some industry experts predict could top $1 billion.Tucked away on Page 8, the sentences refer vaguely to plans to repeal or roll back “numerous” exclusions and deductions, and to “modernize” tax rules affecting specific industries “to ensure that the tax code better reflects economic reality and that such rules provide little opportunity for tax avoidance.”That language has prompted concerns among a wide range of businesses and industries about the prospect of losing valuable tax breaks — from preferential tax treatment for insurers to credits for renewable energy to a prized tax treatment used by the commercial real estate industry.And those fears are being stoked by lobbyists, who are urging clients and prospective clients to get out in front of any changes that could eliminate or weaken sections of the tax code that benefit them.“You’re either going to be at the table, or you’re going to be on the table,” said Thomas M. Reynolds, a former Republican congressman from New York who served on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and is now a lobbyist at Holland & Knight focusing on tax issues. Most businesses that could be affected by the tax overhaul “will not have to be encouraged to engage,” Mr. Reynolds said.“Everybody is beginning to pay attention, and there is going to be a flurry of people looking for representation,” he added.The spike in tax-related lobbying is already well underway, prompted by Mr. Trump’s campaign-trail pledge that fundamentally overhauling the tax code would be one of his top priorities in the White House. Companies and trade associations have submitted nearly 450 filings to lobby on tax issues from the beginning of the year through the end of last week, compared with fewer than 265 filings for all of 2016, according to congressional lobbying disclosures.There is some irony in Mr. Trump’s setting off a surge in lobbying spending, given his campaign promise to “drain the swamp” in the nation’s capital, partly by taking on special interests. But there is perhaps no federal law that has been lobbied as assiduously as the tax code. Its thousands of pages contain countless provisions inserted at the behest of specific groups that have an interest in protecting their benefits.“People have been expecting this all year. But the feeling that specific provisions could be put in play is now more real, and all of those provisions have a constituency and a lobbyist,” said Randolf H. Hardock, a tax lobbyist at Davis & Harman. “Some of it is just keeping clients informed, even if they don’t ultimately engage, because there are issues that could come up right at the end, where if you’re not paying attention, you could miss them.”In 1986 — the last time Congress overhauled the tax code — Mr. Hardock served as tax counsel for the Senate Finance Committee. That legislation, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, became the subject of such intense lobbying activity from interest groups and individual companies that it was jokingly referred to on K Street as the Lobbyists’ Relief Act of 1986.Lobbying has expanded and evolved drastically since then: It’s now a $3 billion industry with a sophisticated war-room approach that goes beyond simply buttonholing lawmakers to include comprehensive marketing and pressure campaigns.Those costly campaigns can pay off, as they did for those fighting a proposed tax on imports championed by many Republicans, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. A coalition of major retailers such as Wal-Mart, retail trade associations and manufacturers including Koch Industries banded together earlier this year with the single goal of killing the so-called border adjustment tax.The group, Americans for Affordable Products, spent heavily on research, slick television ads and constituent visits to key lawmakers in the first few months of the year. In April, the Trump administration backed away from the tax, which was not included in Wednesday’s blueprint.But while the tax on imports was a clear target, the paucity of details in the new blueprint has created anxiety in corporate suites across the country, despite the overwhelming support in the business community for its proposed reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.Lobbyists are potentially facing two rounds of business-development opportunities: one in which they capitalize on the fear of getting attacked, and another when specific industries come under attack.Meanwhile, the details revealed so far are creating fissures within industries, such as real estate, as trade groups battle one another in an effort to strip out or protect various provisions under consideration.The National Association of Realtors is already out in force, criticizing aspects of the plan as dealing a devastating blow to the housing market and United States economy. While the framework specifically protects the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents say the proposal to double the standard deduction and eliminate the state and local tax deduction would make buying a home less valuable.The National Association of Home Builders, by contrast, has come out in favor of the framework, saying the lower corporate tax rate, a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses, and protection of the low-income housing tax credit will help builders, whose businesses benefit from both renters and home buyers.“By lowering the pass-through rate, the plan will reduce the tax bill of thousands of small businesses and help to spur job and economic growth,” the chairman of the home builders association, Granger MacDonald, said in a statement. “More importantly, the blueprint maintains the low-income housing tax credit, the most indispensable tool to help produce affordable rental housing.”Meredith McGehee, the chief of policy at Issue One, a nonprofit group that works to reduce the influence of deep-pocketed special interests in politics and government, said that “the estimate of $1 billion in lobbying expenditures is probably conservative.”Ms. McGehee, who has been both tracking lobbying and actually lobbying since 1987, predicted that many of the efforts to influence the details of the tax overhaul would not be disclosed under congressional lobbying rules because they would fall outside the scope of the direct contacts with federal government officials that prompt disclosure requirements.Several tax lobbyists said businesses and trade groups concerned about whether they could be in jeopardy as the plan develops should look to a tax reform bill released in 2014 by the House Ways and Means Committee under its then-chairman, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, a Republican who retired in 2015. That bill proposed ending all manner of loopholes and credits, including for insurance companies and research and experimentation.“You have to be out there working to make the case now, because everybody knows what the menu includes,” said James Gould, a tax lobbyist who worked as a Senate tax aide during the 1986 reform effort.But Mr. Hardock said there might be some benefit in trying to stay out of the debate for companies or trade groups in industries that aren’t being openly discussed as targets for revenue generation.“There are some industries that probably don’t want to put their heads too far up, because that might draw unwelcome notice,” he said."
"WASHINGTON — Anna C. Corbin had not been involved in politics, had not even been to the Capitol before this year. But since March, she has made the two-hour drive here from her home in Hanover, Pa., 15 times so her sons, Jackson and Henry, could lobby against efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.Jackson, 12, and Henry, 9, have a genetic condition known as Noonan syndrome, which causes a bleeding disorder, short stature and digestion problems. They also have a new profession — “little lobbyists.”In the long-running battle over health care, doctors, hospitals and insurance companies have spent millions of dollars this year. But some of the most effective advocacy has come from pint-size petitioners who spent nothing at all: children with serious medical needs who told their stories to members of Congress.“We were often told that the kids were not voters,” Ms. Corbin said. “But they will have this genetic condition for the rest of their lives. They will be voters, and these laws will affect them. So it’s important for them to have a voice.”Children like Jackson and Henry put a human face on the debate over insurance regulation, premium subsidies, Medicaid expansion and cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America’s Health Insurance Plans and dozens of other industry groups lined up against the Republican repeal bills. But, lawmakers said, what really sank the legislation was the outpouring from constituents, and few were as influential as the little lobbyists who pleaded for their own lives and the lives of other children with special needs.“They are fantastic,” said Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. “These kids and their parents demonstrated how catastrophic the Medicaid cuts would be. They really added value to this debate and helped us win.”Rebecca A. Wood’s family has employer-sponsored health insurance, but under a federal waiver granted to the State of Virginia, Medicaid pays about $15,000 a year for items and services that are not covered by insurance. That matters to her daughter, Charlie Wood, 5, who was born more than three months early, weighed 1 pound 12 ounces and was in the neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital for 10 weeks.Charlie has a mild form of cerebral palsy and developmental delays, has seen more than a half-dozen medical specialists and uses a feeding tube. She still started kindergarten in Charlottesville, Va., on time this year, but her mother said she saw another threat coming: The bills passed by the House and considered in the Senate would have made deep cuts in projected Medicaid spending, imposing an annual cap on federal payments to each state.“After the presidential election, I knew that health care would be a huge issue,” Ms. Wood said. “I wanted people to know, when you cut health care, it affects many innocent people like my daughter. I wanted them to see the faces behind the cuts.”“Without the Affordable Care Act,” Ms. Wood said, “Charlie would have exceeded her lifetime cap before ever coming home from the hospital and would have been uninsurable.”The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said the young lobbyists “have made all the difference in the world.” And she described the parents as formidable: “You do not want to stand in between one of these moms and the good health care of her child.”The effort started when five families visited Senate offices in June for a day of lobbying.“It took off from there,” said Elena Hung, a co-founder of the group, whose 3-year-old daughter, Xiomara, has chronic lung and kidney disease. Since then, nearly 300 families in 47 states have shared their stories with lawmakers through the group.They are relieved that the Senate shelved plans for a vote last week, but fully expect the battle to continue. President Trump predicted that the Senate would try again in the first quarter of next year and said Republicans would “have the votes.”Five-year-old Melanie Carrigg, from Tucson, visited 60 Senate offices and met with Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who ended up voting for the repeal bills in July.Melanie, one of more than 34 million children covered by Medicaid, has Down syndrome and a heart defect and is deaf, said her mother, Austin G. Carrigg.When the latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act collapsed in the Senate, Ms. Carrigg was happy. But she said: “I’m a realist. I know this fight is not over.”Ms. Carrigg and her daughter visited the offices of two Republican senators who voted against the repeal bills in July, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.“We have given information to their staff numerous times,” Ms. Carrigg said. “When you walk in and a staffer says, ‘Oh, they were just talking about you,’ you think, maybe we are making an impression. That has been my personal goal every time. I want them to remember my daughter’s face when they go on the floor and vote.”"
"WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out at the mayor of San Juan on Saturday for criticizing his administration’s efforts to help Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, accusing her of “poor leadership” and implying that the people of the devastated island were not doing enough to help themselves.As emergency workers and troops struggled to restore basic services in a commonwealth with no electricity and limited fuel and water, Mr. Trump spent the day at his New Jersey golf club, blasting out Twitter messages defending his response to the storm and repeatedly assailing the capital’s mayor, Carmen Yulín Cruz, and the news media.“The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,” the president wrote on Twitter. “Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.”Mr. Trump said the people of Puerto Rico should not depend entirely on the federal government. “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort,” he wrote. “10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job. The military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc., have done an amazing job. Puerto Rico was totally destroyed.”The president’s stream of Twitter bolts appeared repeatedly over the course of 12 hours and touched off a furious day of recriminations that fueled questions about his leadership during the crisis. Although Mr. Trump earned generally high marks for his handling of hurricanes that struck Texas and Florida recently, he has been sharply criticized for being slow to sense the magnitude of the damage in Puerto Rico, an American territory, and project urgency about helping.He has explained that the challenges are different because Puerto Rico is “an island surrounded by water — big water, ocean water,” as he put it on Friday, but in recent days he has stepped up his public statements and dispatched a three-star general to take over the response. Mr. Trump’s aggressive Twitter messages on Saturday were in keeping with how he has acted during other moments of crisis, notably when he assailed the mayor of London, who is Muslim, after a terrorist attack, asserting that he did not take the threat seriously enough.In the case of Ms. Cruz, Mr. Trump took her outcry as a personal assault on him. While other presidents generally ignore most of the criticism they invariably attract, Mr. Trump is not one to let anything go unanswered. In one of his books, he titled a chapter “Revenge,” writing that “when someone crosses you, my advice is ‘Get even!’ If you do not get even, you are just a schmuck!”His attack on Ms. Cruz on Saturday was amplified by a top aide, who retweeted a message she had written during last year’s campaign endorsing Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. “@realDonaldTrump hater, the Mayor of San Juan — is the perfect example of an opportunistic politician,” wrote Dan Scavino Jr., the president’s social media director.Responding to Mr. Trump’s tweets on Saturday, Ms. Cruz said she would not be distracted by “small comments” and denied that she was attacking the president at the behest of the Democrats. “Actually, I was asking for help,” she told MSNBC. “I wasn’t saying anything nasty about the president.”She pointed to comments made on Friday by Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who is leading the response effort and who said on Friday that he did not have enough troops and equipment. “So who am I?” Ms. Cruz asked. “I’m just a little mayor from the capital city of San Juan. This is a three-star general telling the world that right now he does not have the appropriate means and tools to take care of the situation.”The attacks on the mayor generated a backlash from celebrities and others who noted that the president was spending the weekend in the comfort of his golf club while the mayor was struggling to help her constituents on an island with no power. “She has been working 24/7,” Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton,” the hit Broadway musical, wrote on Twitter. “You have been GOLFING. You’re going straight to hell. Fastest golf cart you ever took.”Lady Gaga, who has twice as many Twitter followers as the president, said that “it’s clear where the ‘poor leadership’ lies @realDonaldTrump” and added that he was “not helping PR because of the electoral votes u need to be re-elected.” As an American territory, Puerto Rico does not have votes in the Electoral College, which determines the presidency every four years.Russel L. Honoré, the retired lieutenant general who took over the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 after an initially inadequate federal effort, also noted the president’s weekend retreat. “The mayor’s living on a cot, and I hope the president has a good day at golf,” he said on CNN.The president was out of sight on Saturday, secluded at his club in Bedminster, N.J., miles away from the pool of journalists who follow him. Aides would not say whether he went golfing, although they said he had telephone calls scheduled with Puerto Rico’s governor and the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Ms. Cruz became a powerful voice of grievance on Friday when she went on television to plead for help and reject assertions by the Trump administration about how well it was responding. She was incensed by comments made by Elaine Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, who had said on Thursday that it was “really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths” from the hurricane.“This is, damn it, this is not a good news story,” Ms. Cruz said on CNN. “This is a ‘people are dying’ story. This is a ‘life or death’ story. This is ‘there’s a truckload of stuff that cannot be taken to people’ story. This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen.”Ms. Duke traveled to Puerto Rico on Friday and tried to smooth things over, agreeing that the situation on the ground was “not satisfactory.”General Buchanan, who arrived in Puerto Rico on Thursday to take over the hurricane response, said on Friday that he needed more personnel and resources. “The answer is no, it’s not enough and we’re bringing more in,” he said on CNN.Ms. Cruz, a member of the Popular Democratic Party, which advocates maintaining the island’s commonwealth status, was unmollified and went back on CNN on Friday night to continue her pleas for help wearing a black T-shirt that said, “Help Us, We Are Dying.”“We’re dying here,” she told the anchor Anderson Cooper. “We truly are dying here. And I keep saying it, SOS. If anyone can hear us, if Mr. Trump can hear us, let’s just get it over with and get the ball rolling.”At least 16 people have died in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Maria, which came soon after Hurricane Irma, although that number could rise. The island has a population of 3.4 million people, roughly the same as Connecticut. In addition to appointing General Buchanan, the Trump administration has waived the Jones Act, a maritime commerce statute that was seen as a hindrance to relief efforts.Mr. Trump plans to travel to Puerto Rico with his wife, Melania, on Tuesday, nearly two weeks after the hurricane slammed into the island but the earliest he said he could get there without diverting resources from the rescue and recovery efforts. He said on Saturday that he would also “hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands,” where 100,000 American citizens are also struggling to recover from storm devastation.The president dismissed complaints about the federal response as distortions from the news media. “Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to ‘get Trump,’” he wrote. “Not fair to FR or effort!”Hours later, he added: “Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor. Doing everything we can to help great people of PR!”"
"It’s a tough time to be a male feminist, especially in Hollywood.A few weeks ago, Kai Cole, the ex-wife of Joss Whedon, the man who created “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and who has been honored for creating strong female characters, wrote a highly personal takedown of him for The Wrap, a Hollywood industry website.In the post, Ms. Cole, a film producer, said that Mr. Whedon “hid multiple affairs” with “his actresses, co-workers, fans and friends” during their 16-year marriage. His explanation for why he had so many female friends, she said, was that “his mother raised him as a feminist.”Moreover, Ms. Cole called out his “hypocrisy” for “preaching feminist ideals” while using their marriage as a “shield” to commit adultery. In essence, she branded Mr. Whedon, the director of the coming “Justice League” superhero film, a fake male feminist.It’s a label that appears to be gaining cultural currency, especially in the Trump era.“Saturday Night Live” aired a sketch last season called “Girl at a Bar” in which a succession of seemingly sensitive male feminists (“I worked for Hillary,” one says) try to pick up a woman at a bar, only to resort to misogynistic language when rebuffed.The three-minute sketch seemed to have hit a chord. Myriad essays that decried wolves in pink pussy hats and “woke misogynists” followed. “Watch S.N.L. Demolish Fake Male Feminists,” read a Vanity Fair headline. “Hating Trump Doesn’t Make a Man a Feminist,” said Bustle, an online culture magazine for women, which argued that “male feminists” have become a “powerful cultural niche,” and cited numerous celebrity examples including Ryan Gosling, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Pratt.Tal Peretz, an assistant professor at Auburn University who specializes in gender studies, sees the criticism of male feminists as an inevitable consequence of social progress. “More men are getting involved in the feminist and women’s rights movements, and I think that the learning curve for them is really steep and really long,” said Dr. Peretz, who is an author of “Some Men: Feminist Allies and the Movement to End Violence Against Women.” “Our bar for men in feminism is getting higher, too, and rightly so.”Examples of these higher standards abound.Critics of men who sport “The Future is Female” T-shirts also maintain that some are using the word “feminist” inappropriately. The preferred term, they argue, is “feminist allies.” The rationale is that white people who fight against racism wouldn’t call themselves “black,” just as straight people who rally for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights wouldn’t call themselves “transgender.”BuzzFeed recently published “17 Types of Male ‘Feminists’ That Need to Be Stopped,” an illustrated list that included a new father who suddenly becomes a feminist after he has a daughter, and a male manager who congratulates himself for hiring a female employee.“It’s something I encounter all the time, but that man Robbie Tripp was the real kick in the pants in inspiring the post,” said Loryn Brantz, who wrote and illustrated the article and is also the author of the book “Feminist Baby.”Mr. Tripp is the San Francisco man who became an internet sensation this summer when he posted a gushing ode to his wife’s “curvy body” on Instagram. People were divided on his seemingly self-congratulatory realization that “the media marginalizes women,” and his appreciation of his wife’s “thick thighs, big booty, cute little side roll.” Some cooed and said “Ah”; others sneered and said “Ew.”“Good Morning America” interviewed the couple in a segment titled “Hero Husband or Fake Feminist?” The culture site Refinery29 dismissed Mr. Tripp’s paean as “the worst type of ‘male feminism.’”Celebrities also weighed in. Melanie Lynskey, who will star in the TV series “Castle Rock,” said on Twitter: “Public announcements of devotion are very sexy to me,” she said. “What isn’t sexy is acting as though you’re one of the few men on earth who could possibly love a woman who looks like that.”Dr. Peretz has coined a term, “the Pedestal Effect,” to describe how men are given special treatment for small acts of gender equality, like changing a diaper or Mr. Tripp’s love letter. “It is basically when guys get a whole lot of bonus points just for being nominal feminists,” he said.Mr. Whedon’s agent did not respond to requests for comment, but a representative released a statement to The Wrap that read: “While this account includes inaccuracies and misrepresentations which can be harmful to their family, Joss is not commenting, out of concern for his children and out of respect for his ex-wife.”Mr. Whedon did, however, give an interview to BuzzFeed in 2015 that seems to have foreshadowed the current hubbub.“When you declare yourself politically, you destroy yourself artistically,” he said in an article about why he deleted his Twitter account (he has since returned). “Because suddenly that’s the litmus test for everything you do — for example, in my case, feminism. If you don’t live up to the litmus test of feminism in this one instance, then you’re a misogynist,” he added. “It circles directly back upon you.”"
"SAN FRANCISCO — Google has become the latest Silicon Valley giant to become entangled in a widening investigation into how online social networks and technology products may have played a role in Russian interference in the 2016 election.On Friday evening, Google said it would cooperate with congressional inquiries into the election, days after Facebook and Twitter provided evidence to investigators of accounts on their networks that were linked to Russian groups. Google was called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.Google has also begun an internal investigation into whether its advertising products and services were used as part of a Russia-linked influence campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the issue. Exactly when the inquiry began is not known, but it has been discussed inside Google over recent weeks, the person said.The Wall Street Journal reported the internal investigation earlier.Google’s search engine, with about a 90 percent market share, is an inescapable part of the internet, so it was no surprise that congressional investigators turned toward the company. Google is the only company that sells more digital advertising than Facebook, and its YouTube service is the go-to place for videos on the internet.On Thursday, Twitter said in a closed-door briefing for the Senate and House intelligence panels that it had found about 200 accounts — a fraction of the number of potentially compromised accounts found by outside researchers — that appeared to be linked to a Russian campaign to influence the election.Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sharply criticized Twitter for not aggressively investigating its own systems to provide a more complete picture of Russian activities.The sharp rebuke of Twitter came after Facebook’s admission to the two intelligence panels that it had connected 470 profiles and pages to a Russian company with ties to the Kremlin. Facebook also said the pages had placed 3,000 ads on Facebook at a cost of about $100,000.The technology news site Recode reported earlier that Facebook had shared some details about Russian-linked profiles on its platform with Google, but the search giant’s investigation is expected to broaden beyond those leads, according to the person familiar with the matter.What direction the congressional investigation into Google will take is not clear. Google is much larger than Facebook or Twitter, and it has a wide range of services that played a role in the dissemination of so-called fake news during the campaign.But it is not a social network like Facebook or Twitter, making it harder for blatantly untrue stories to catch on, or for public sentiment to be stirred up through carefully targeted posts.Google has, however, long dealt with people trying to game its search engine to highlight misleading information or use its AdSense advertising network to finance eye-catching but false news stories. YouTube is also fertile ground for offensive videos and misleading news stories.“We will of course cooperate with inquiries; we’re looking into how we can help with any relevant information,” Google said in a statement late Friday.In April, Google said it had found that about 0.25 percent of its daily search traffic was linking to intentionally misleading, false or offensive information. The most prominent example occurred in the days after the election, when the top Google search result for “final election vote count 2016” linked to a story that incorrectly said that Donald J. Trump, who had secured the presidency by winning the Electoral College, had also defeated Hillary Clinton in the popular vote.In an effort to keep false stories out of its results and offensive suggestions out of potential search queries, Google started an initiative called “Project Owl” to provide “algorithmic updates to surface more authoritative content.”Similar to the way content that receives more attention is often more heavily promoted on Facebook and Twitter, Google’s search engine gives more weight to results that are more frequently clicked on. It is one of hundreds of factors that go into ranking links.The company has also been working on shutting access to AdSense for sites that spread misinformation. Google’s ad network is widely used by other websites and is often their only source of revenue. AdSense allows marketers to target users by different criteria, but it does not offer the same detail as Facebook, which can slice and dice its audience by their interests, including political leanings.In late January, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from AdSense — a tiny number compared to the more than two million publishers registered on AdSense.At the time, Google said it reviewed 550 sites “suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations” in November and December and took action against 340 of them."
"Herbert W. Kalmbach, Richard M. Nixon’s personal lawyer and a conduit for hush money from the 1972 presidential campaign to the Watergate burglars, died on Sept. 15 in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 95.His death, which was not widely reported at the time, was announced by his children on Friday in a paid death notice in The Los Angeles Times.Mr. Kalmbach was briefly imprisoned and temporarily lost his law license for illegally raising vast bundles of cash, much of it furtively exacted from corporations and individuals.He oversaw a secret $500,000 stash to finance sabotage and spy operations against the Democrats run by the Nixon political operative Donald H. Segretti. He funneled $220,000 to pay off the seven defendants who had bungled the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex. And he steered $100,000 to an unsuccessful campaign to defeat George C. Wallace’s comeback as governor of Alabama in 1970.Mr. Kalmbach also conveyed to the Nixon re-election war chest $2 million from the milk industry, which was promised federal subsidies. The money, from a dairy cooperative organization, came disguised illegally as small contributions.In another episode, after withdrawing $100,000 earmarked for the anti-Wallace effort from a safe deposit box, he hand-delivered the cash to a stranger in the lobby of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in New York, identifying himself as “Mr. Jensen of Detroit.”Mr. Kalmbach later testified that when John W. Dean III, the president’s counsel, instructed him to meet him in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, to discuss the hush money, he was cued to wave his arms boisterously during their conversation so that they would not appear to be conspiratorial.“It was like a Grade B thriller,” Mr. Kalmbach said.On Feb. 25, 1974, he pleaded guilty to violating the Federal Corrupt Practices Act by raising $3.9 million for a secret Republican congressional campaign committee. The money included a $100,000 contribution from an ambassador who was promised an even more prestigious post.On June 17, Judge John J. Sirica, in United States District Court in Washington, sentenced Mr. Kalmbach to up to 18 months in prison. But Mr. Kalmbach wound up serving only a third of that, 191 days, when Judge Sirica released him the following January, citing his cooperation with prosecutors.Though he admitted that he had violated federal law, Mr. Kalmbach, in his own defense, testified that he had solicited money for the Watergate burglars and had delivered it to them because he had been told that it was being granted on “humanitarian” grounds — to pay for the men’s legal fees and to support their families — and that it had been authorized by John D. Ehrlichman, the president’s assistant for domestic affairs, and by Mr. Dean.“The fact that I had been directed to undertake these actions by the No. 2 and No. 3 men on the White House staff,” Mr. Kalmbach said, “made it absolutely incomprehensible to me that my actions in this regard could have been regarded in any way as improper or unethical.”Herbert Warren Kalmbach was born on Oct. 19, 1921, in Port Huron, Mich. When he was only 14, he contrived an airplane de-icer, which was reproduced in Popular Mechanics magazine. After serving in the Navy, he taught celestial navigation at the United States Naval Academy.He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1949 and a law degree in 1951 from the University of Southern California and was admitted to the bar in 1952. He became friendly with Nixon later in the 1950s after being introduced by H. R. Haldeman, Nixon’s future chief of staff.His wife, Barbara Forbush Kalmbach, a former Rose Bowl princess, died in 2005. He is survived by a daughter, Lauren Kinsey, and a son, Kurt. Another son, Kenneth, died in 1980.After Nixon was elected president in 1968, Mr. Kalmbach rejected an offer to be deputy commerce secretary. Instead, he profited enormously as a real estate lawyer representing corporate clients who hoped to cash in on his personal relationship with the president. Mr. Kalmbach had handled Nixon’s income tax returns and matters involving his home in San Clemente, Calif.Considered trustworthy and discreet, he was enlisted as deputy finance chairman of the 1972 re-election campaign. But he rapidly became embroiled in illegal fund-raising. After the break-in that June, he was instructed to deliver money to the Watergate defendants through a bagman, Anthony Ulasewicz, a former New York City police detective who had been on the Nixon campaign’s private payroll.It was unclear whether the payments were made with the president’s direct approval.“I had the feeling that someone in some manner expressly had directed these people to go forward on this assignment,” Mr. Kalmbach testified, “and the assignment was, as I say, stupid and illegal — idiotic — but there was a feeling that as long as they had been directed to undertake this, that there was at least a moral obligation to provide for lawyers for them and for the support of their families.”Mr. Kalmbach was asked during the Senate Watergate hearings if, as a lawyer, he would have advised a client to do what he did.“If the client had come to me in this situation, which is wholly separate from any situation that I could believe anyone would be faced with, I would have asked him to exercise caution and make inquiries,” he replied. “But in my situation, Senator, I was dealing with the counsel to the president of the United States. It was a matter of absolute trust in the man’s integrity and honesty.”"
"WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican whose public feud with President Trump had already fueled a primary challenge from the right, now has reason to worry about his left flank: Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a centrist Democrat with a powerful biography, announced she will seek Mr. Flake’s Senate seat in 2018.Her entry into the race — just days after a populist Republican toppled Senator Luther Strange in a Republican primary runoff — is the latest worrisome sign for Republicans as they confront deep divisions in their party. For Mr. Flake, who is finishing his freshman term with low job approval ratings at home, it means being squeezed from both sides.“Flake is now getting attacked both from the right and the left,’’ said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “He shouldn’t be that vulnerable. Trump carried Arizona by four points, so Flake should start this race with an advantage. But having a competitive primary to his right and a first-tier candidate to his left really engages this seat.’’Mr. Flake and Senator Dean Heller of Nevada are the only Republicans up for re-election in 2018 who are considered vulnerable, during a cycle where the electoral map tilts strongly toward Republicans. With Ms. Sinema’s entry, Ms. Duffy now categorizes the Arizona Senate race as a ‘tossup.Ms. Sinema, 41, is the Democrats’ preferred candidate, and the party moved quickly to embrace her after she announced her candidacy on Thursday night. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee endorsed her on Friday, sending a signal to other Democrats — including Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, who has been contemplating a run — that they are unwelcome in the race.“We’re lucky that Kyrsten’s running,’’ said J.B. Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC, a political action committee devoted to electing Democrats to the Senate. A recent poll conducted for the committee found that just 38 percent of Arizonans approve of Mr. Flake’s performance.In Washington, Ms. Sinema, the first openly bisexual member of Congress, has positioned herself as a centrist, devoting herself to such issues as veterans affairs. In a video announcing her candidacy, she spotlighted her biography: Her family was homeless when she was a child, she said, and spent nearly three years living in an abandoned gas station without running water or electricity.For a while, the family received food stamps, she said, adding that she made it to Congress with help from ‘‘family, church and sometimes even government.’’The Flake campaign made clear that it intends to portray Ms. Sinema as too liberal for Arizona. “From her time working on Ralph Nader’s campaign to the state legislature to Congress, Kyrsten Sinema has always been out of touch with Arizona and she’ll do anything to hide her progressive record,” a campaign spokesman, Will Allison, said in a statement.Mr. Flake’s Republican primary opponent is Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who ran an unsuccessful primary race last year against Arizona’s other Republican senator, John McCain. Ms. Ward developed name recognition during that race that will be helpful this time around.She is drawing interest from the populist wing of Mr. Trump’s party, including from Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist.Mr. Flake’s new book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” has also stoked anger among Trump supporters both in and outside of Arizona. In blistering terms, the senator rails against Mr. Trump and conservatives who have embraced him. The president, in turn, has gone after Mr. Flake on Twitter and at a rally in Arizona.“Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He’s toxic!,’’ Mr. Trump tweeted in August, just a few days before his Arizona trip.Analysts say Mr. Flake’s biggest challenge will be defining himself to Arizona voters; although he has been in the Senate since 2013 and served in the House before that, many do not know what he stands for.“This is really going to be a vote about him and his incumbency and where he would define he wants things to go,” said David Winston, a Republican strategist. “So the good news for Flake is that’s a narrative that he can potentially drive. The challenge is what he wants that narrative to be.”"
"WASHINGTON — As he traversed the world on taxpayer-funded flights, Tom Price made it a habit to write home, repeatedly sending celebratory letters back to staff members at the Department of Health and Human Services detailing his time on the road, and complimenting agency employees who “ensure the good stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”In May, Mr. Price celebrated his 15th week on the job by detailing his trip to Geneva, snapping a photo of the lush grounds of the United Nations compound, and a mountain range in the distance, as he attended the World Health Assembly.Weeks later, opening with the words “another fantastic week,” Mr. Price described a June trip to Nashville, Tenn., where he owns a condominium, leaving out the fact that he had flown on a chartered plane and, according to Politico, stopped to have lunch with his son.The “Week in Review” travelogues from Mr. Price, who resigned under fire on Friday, were sent to the department’s approximately 80,000 employees. At times they included links to a Flickr account, where agency staff members posted more than 1,800 photographs of Mr. Price’s globe-trotting and other agency work, including a recent dinner in Liberia.The dispatches outraged many members of the department staff, given that the travel took place at a time when the agency is facing hundreds of billions of dollars in proposed budget cuts, as well as certain budget-related restrictions on work-related travel for employees.“I can’t comprehend that someone wants to throw people out of nursing homes, take millions off Medicaid and deny children and the disabled health care, but is riding around in private chartered jets, at times taking his wife,” said J. David Cox, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers’ union, who spoke shortly before Mr. Price’s resignation. “This is like an episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.’’Mr. Price did not begin the practice of the “Week in Review” dispatches, which were also sent by Sylvia M. Burwell, Mr. Price’s predecessor in the Obama administration. In September 2016, Ms. Burwell discussed a trip she took to Rio de Janeiro to attend the Paralympic Games, as well as trips to Ohio, Iowa and Florida in July 2016 — all three of them swing states — to see how the Obama administration’s health care effort had brought “important new tools to help people live healthier lives.”But a former official under Ms. Burwell told CNN that the former secretary generally flew commercial flights for trips. Ms. Burwell did not respond Friday to a request for comment.Mr. Price, who was publicly rebuked on Wednesday by Mr. Trump for running up at least $400,000 in charges on private jets, drew the president’s ire again on Friday, only hours before his resignation. “I certainly don’t like the optics,’’ Mr. Trump told reporters, although he called Mr. Price “a very fine man.’’“I’m not happy, I can tell you that,” the president said. “I’m not happy.”Mr. Price’s travels included a trip last summer to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado, where he flexed his muscles in a group photo. And in an Aug. 18 letter titled “Hello From Alaska!”, Mr. Price updated staff members on plans to revamp the agency “to put people at the center of our work to be responsive and innovative.”In all, there were 28 photo-filled, week-in-review updates so far. A dozen discuss Mr. Price’s official travels to various spots worldwide, including Texas after Hurricane Harvey, as well as to several communities struggling with the opioid drug crisis.Travel on private planes has been a source of trouble before for high-level federal employees, including John H. Sununu, who resigned from his post as chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush in 1991, after he was criticized for his use frequent use of military planes as well as a private jet for political events.A congressional investigation during the tenure of President George W. Bush also found that over a five-year period ending in 2006, cabinet officials and agency heads at ten departments and agencies traveled aboard leased or chartered private aircraft on at least 125 trips to more than 300 locations, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $1.5 million.Tesia D. Williams, a spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office, said Friday that her office started looking into Mr. Price’s travel on Sept. 18, following the first of a series of Politico stories that have so far reported that the secretary has run up more than $1 million in noncommercial flights. Those trips include the flight to Nashville and another trip to Georgia, where Mr. Price spoke at a medical conference near a resort island where he owns property.The inspector general’s office, Ms. Williams said, “is conducting a review of Secretary Price’s Federal travel using chartered aircraft. The review focuses on whether the travel complied with Federal Travel Regulations, but may encompass other issues related to the travel.”“We take this matter very seriously, and when questions arose about potentially inappropriate travel, we immediately began assessing the issue,” Ms. Williams added. “Work is underway and will be completed as soon as possible.”This week, the House Oversight Committee began an investigation into the travel of Mr. Trump’s senior administration members. The inquiry, opened by Representatives Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee’s chairman, and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the panel’s ranking Democrat, will examine the use of private and government travel by senior officials from 24 federal agencies.The committee has requested passenger names, destinations and the source of payment for each trip, among other details, to be turned in by Oct. 10.Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a liberal nonprofit group, said he has a hard time accepting Mr. Trump’s angry reaction to Mr. Price given that the president has repeatedly flown on Air Force One to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, and other destinations.“He himself personifies the problem,” Mr. Weissman said. “But there is no protective shield for the rest of the cabinet. The president seems to think he can get away with things, but the cabinet cannot.”In statements and in television interviews, Mr. Price did not dispute the reporting surrounding his travel.“It is clear to me that in this case, I was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer,” Mr. Price said in a statement on Thursday. “I know as well as anyone that the American people want to know that their hard-earned dollars are being spent wisely by government officials.”Over the course of the week Mr. Price said repeatedly that his trips cleared both legal and administrative hurdles within his agency. Mr. Price also has said he would stop taking private jets and instituted an internal review of agency policies."
"The Department of Veterans Affairs is pushing to suspend a 50-year-old ethics law that prevents employees from receiving money or owning a stake in for-profit colleges that pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in tuition paid through the G.I. Bill of Rights.The agency says the conflict-of-interest law — enacted after scandals enveloped the for-profit education industry — is now redundant and outdated, with “illogical and unintended consequences” affecting employees who have no real conflict of interest, such as a V.A. doctor teaching a course at a school attended by veterans with educational benefits.But veterans’ groups and ethics experts reject those arguments and say the department is abandoning protections for veterans and taxpayers. They worry that the effort is part of a larger rollback of federal safeguards that were instituted before President Trump took office to combat abuses and fraud by for-profit colleges.Several officials who worked in the for-profit college industry and had criticized the Obama-era crackdown as excessive, for example, have joined the Education Department, which administers and polices the federal student loan program and the industry.The proposal to suspend the ethics law was published in the Federal Register in mid-September and is scheduled to take effect on Oct. 16, but no public hearings have been scheduled and no public comments have yet been submitted.“It’s just reckless and sloppy,” said Walter M. Shaub Jr., a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, said of the agency’s action. He questioned why such a blanket exception for more than 330,000 agency employees should exist when the law allows waivers for individuals or even classes of individuals, like those teaching courses. Invoking the waiver also requires public hearings, he said.Most troubling to Mr. Shaub, now senior counsel at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, is that the move seems like an attempt by the executive branch to overrule the legislative branch. “They are saying the statute is unreasonable, but that’s not for them to say,” he said of agency officials.Curtis Cashour, a V.A. spokesman, said officials had focused on the ethics law after the agency’s inspector general investigated complaints this year that two V.A. employees were teaching at a for-profit institution. There were no significant conflicts and a waiver was ultimately granted, he said, but the report led to worries among many employees about the impact of more rigorous enforcement.“Our response was aimed at easing the concerns of numerous V.A. employees,” Mr. Cashour said in an email, adding that the ethics law had been superseded by subsequent conflict-of-interest statutes.One concern of critics is that officials at the organization’s upper levels could be making decisions about a college in which they have a financial interest, like permitting a school with a record of abuses to recruit at military bases. Another is that people advising veterans about their educational benefits could steer students to a particular school because they were on the payroll.“There’s no good that can come from allowing colleges to have unseemly financial entanglements with V.A. employees,” Carrie Wofford, director of Veterans Education Success, a nonprofit advocacy group. “Congress enacted a zero tolerance for financial conflicts of interest for V.A. employees precisely because Congress uncovered massive fraud by for-profit colleges targeting veterans.”She added that “student veterans were already facing an aggressive rollback of their protections under the Trump administration’s Education Department.”Two months ago, the Republican-led Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report during its debate over the military budget instructing the department to review the statute — but its concern was that the current rules “may be inadequate to identify conflicts of interest that can develop” because of gifts or expensive meals.Veterans are particularly valuable as potential students: There are limits on the federal funds that for-profit schools can receive, but money from the G.I. Bill is not counted.Even before last year’s presidential election, some of the biggest veterans and military organizations were urging the department to better monitor for-profit colleges that were misleading veterans about the costs and benefits of enrolling, and violating legal and regulatory standards.And a report issued in July by the director of the agency’s Education Service found that financial issues involving tuition and fees were by far the leading complaint among students who had called the agency’s G.I. Bill hotline since 2014.Some ethics experts disagreed with the department’s contention that other federal statutes made the ethics law unnecessary, saying the agency’s rule sets a higher bar, requiring, for example, more public review.Dozens of other agencies also have supplemental ethics rules that have been written to address potential problems specific to those agencies.Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and a longtime advocate for veterans, said she planned to look into the agency’s decision. “I am deeply concerned the V.A. is opening the door for predatory for-profits to take advantage of men and women who have bravely served our country,” she said."
"WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, resigned under pressure on Friday after racking up at least $400,000 in travel bills for chartered flights and undermining President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp of a corrupt and entitled capital.Already in trouble with Mr. Trump for months of unsuccessful efforts to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care program, Mr. Price failed to defuse the president’s anger by offering regret and a partial reimbursement. His departure was the latest from an administration buffeted by turbulence at the top, and capped a week of setbacks for the president.“I’m not happy, O.K.?” Mr. Trump told reporters who asked about Mr. Price as the president prepared to leave for his New Jersey golf club for the weekend, barely an hour before the resignation was announced. “I can tell you, I’m not happy.” He called Mr. Price “a very good man” but added that the secretary’s offer to pay back the government for just part of the cost of the private flights “would be unacceptable.”Mr. Price ran afoul of one of the president’s most consequential campaign pledges. While some of Mr. Trump’s advisers privately make light of his vow to drain the swamp of Washington privilege, to many of his voters, it was a threshold promise. The firestorm over Mr. Price came as the president was already on the defensive with his base, as the incumbent mainstream Republican senator he backed in an Alabama primary race lost to an insurgent channeling Mr. Trump’s election movement.“It’s hard to see how a cabinet secretary can drain the swamp from 42,000 feet in the plush interior of a taxpayer-funded Gulfstream 4,” said Laura Ingraham, a conservative talk show host and Trump supporter who, like others, defied the president by backing Roy Moore, the insurgent Senate candidate who won in Alabama.Mr. Trump berated Mr. Price in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon for about two hours before heading out to meet with reporters, according to people informed about the meeting. All cabinet travel requests now must be cleared by the White House, they said.The White House’s announcement of Mr. Price’s departure was sparse, with none of the customary thanks for his service; it said simply that he had “offered his resignation earlier today and the president accepted.”In his resignation letter to Mr. Trump, Mr. Price said: “I have spent 40 years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first. I regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives. Success on these issues is more important than any one person. In order for you to move forward without further disruption, I am officially tendering my resignation.”Mr. Trump tapped Don J. Wright, a deputy assistant secretary for health and the director of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, to serve as acting secretary. Possible candidates for a successor include Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.Mr. Price’s job was on the line since the first of a string of reports by Politico, on Sept. 19, about his extensive use of chartered aircraft. The president has fumed privately and publicly about Mr. Price’s actions. Hoping to assuage Mr. Trump, the secretary offered on Thursday to reimburse the government $51,887 — which he said represented the cost of his seat on the trips — of the at least $400,000 spent. But it was not enough to save his job.Mr. Price, a physician and a former Republican congressman from Georgia who had long opposed Mr. Obama’s Affordable Care Act, served as a point man on Mr. Trump’s drive to scrap the law. In July, Mr. Trump said he would fire Mr. Price if he did not get the votes for the legislation.“He better get them,” Mr. Trump told an audience with Mr. Price at his side. “Otherwise, I’ll say, ‘Tom, you’re fired.’”He said it in a jocular fashion, and his audience took it as a jest, but in fact the president has been privately simmering about Mr. Price over the unsuccessful efforts to pass health care legislation in the Senate. While a bill passed the House, the latest effort collapsed this week when enough Senate Republicans defected to deprive Mr. Trump of a majority.Mr. Price had been under fire from the start. During his confirmation hearing in January, Senate Democrats pressed him on the more than $100,000 in pharmaceutical and medical stocks he owned. Democrats said that Mr. Price had understated the value of his 400,613 shares in an Australian company, Innate Immunotherapeutics. He defended himself, saying, “Everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent.”In just eight months since taking office, Mr. Trump has fired or lost a chief of staff, a chief strategist, a national security adviser, a press secretary, two communications directors, a deputy chief of staff, a deputy national security adviser, the F.B.I. director and numerous other aides and advisers.Mr. Price may not be the only senior official to face anger over travel bills. In recent days, a slew of reports about the fast-lane habits of the cabinet have resulted in a mounting public relations headache for the Trump administration, which is stocked by billionaires accustomed to using private jets.Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, used a chartered airplane for several flights, including a $12,000 trip to deliver a speech celebrating a new professional hockey team in Las Vegas. Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has spent more than $58,000 on chartered and military flights, and David Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary, took his wife on a 10-day trip to Europe that mixed business meetings and sightseeing, according to The Washington Post.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked about using a $25,000-an-hour military plane for his European honeymoon and later used a government jet to fly to Fort Knox in Kentucky in August, a trip that offered him a clear view of a solar eclipse, although he later disclaimed any interest.Other cabinet members issued statements explaining their travel practices. The Small Business Administration said its chief, Linda McMahon, had used private air services and that “on the rare occasion” she had, she “covered the entire cost out of her own pocket.” Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, travels on personally owned aircraft “at zero cost to U.S. taxpayers” because she “neither seeks, nor accepts, any reimbursement,” the department said.The sensitivity about the situation within the cabinet was clear on Friday when Mr. Zinke delivered an energy policy address to the Heritage Foundation. He opened his speech by lashing out at what he called “a little B.S.” on chartered flights.“I fly coach,” he said, adding that he uses chartered or military flights only when necessary. “Every time I travel, I submit the travel plans to the ethics department,” he added. “I will always be honest and up front about my travel.”Current and former West Wing officials said oversight of Mr. Trump’s cabinet was so lax in the past that Stephen K. Bannon, then the president’s chief strategist, requested meetings once every 60 days to review each member’s agenda and travel itinerary. The secretaries did not flag the questionable flights, the officials said.John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who has tried to impose a military discipline on a chaotic West Wing with mixed success, has ordered the president’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, to revamp the review process for flights and set limits on prices that cabinet members can pay for transportation, according to two people briefed on the plans.At a recent meeting with legislative affairs aides for cabinet agencies, Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, warned that they should be prepared for additional reports on cabinet secretaries’ expenses, according to a person who attended. Mr. Short said that agencies should assume everything will be made public eventually — and urged the aides to come clean with the president’s staff first.Additionally, Rick Dearborn, a deputy White House chief of staff tasked with overseeing the cabinet, has been in the president’s cross hairs, according to an aide familiar with the situation. Mr. Dearborn accompanied Mr. Trump on his visit to Alabama last week to support Senator Luther Strange, who lost to Mr. Moore in the state’s Republican primary. On the flight back to Washington, the president lashed out at Mr. Dearborn and White House political director Bill Stepien because he was left supporting a candidate who seemed likely to lose, said the aide who was not authorized to be named.Two people on the plane insisted the president never chastised his aides. Another adviser said Mr. Dearborn and Mr. Stepien had both cautioned against the trip, but caught Mr. Trump’s wrath once it went badly.Critics were unmollified by Mr. Price’s departure. “While his resignation ends his time in the government, it does not end the private jet scandal that others in the Trump administration, including Mnuchin, Pruitt and Zinke, find themselves in,” Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a progressive watchdog group, said in a statement.“This administration,” he added, “seems to believe that the government and the taxpayers serve them rather than the other way around.”Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said the episode demonstrated a lack of judgment in the administration.“President Trump talked a big game about draining the swamp, yet he continues to surround himself with staff and administration officials who behave as though a separate set of rules apply to them,” he said. “That must end.”"
"WASHINGTON — The Republican tax plan promoted by President Trump this week as a middle-class tax cut would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and businesses, according to an analysis released on Friday by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.The report, which is the first detailed assessment of the plan’s financial impact, found that the average tax bill for all income groups would decline by $1,600, or 2.1 percent, in 2018. The biggest decrease would go to those with incomes above $730,000, who would see their after-tax incomes rise by an average of 8.5 percent, or about $129,000.Those in the middle quintile — with incomes averaging $66,960 — would see their after-tax income rise by 1.2 percent or about $660.The breakdown is based on the framework released by the “Big Six” group of Republican lawmakers and administration officials this week, which did not include many details that could change the distributional impact. For instance, the plan called for an increase in the child tax credit but did not specify how much it would rise and whether it would be across income groups. The plan also opened the door for adding a fourth, higher tax bracket for the richest Americans, which would also change the distributional impact if enacted.Still, even with those changes, the report makes clear that the plan may not be the salve for the middle class that Mr. Trump has been pitching.The plan would provide enormous benefits to corporate America, with a $2.6 trillion cut in business taxes. Individual income tax revenue would actually increase by $470 billion, largely as a result of changes in personal deductions and exemptions as well as an increase in the bottom tax rate to 12 percent from 10 percent.“Tax collections would shift dramatically from businesses to individuals,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center.The loss of deductions would hit the upper middle class the most, and more than a third of the taxpayers who earn $150,000 to $300,000 could see their taxes go up next year, the report found. They would be hit particularly hard by the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, said on Thursday that the typical American family making $100,000 per year would probably get a $1,000 tax cut next year. He suggested this would stimulate the economy as people put their additional money toward expenditures like kitchen renovations and buying new cars.The Tax Policy Center estimates the plan will cost $2.4 trillion over a decade. Republicans are counting on a surge of economic growth to pay for their tax plan and the Tax Policy Center analysis does not account for those “dynamic” effects. However, the group’s analysts said that its previous studies of recent Republican tax plans showed little impact from growth on revenues, largely because of the likelihood that deficits would lead to higher interest rates.Many aspects of the Republican plan are being left to Congress to decide. Thus far the proposal would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and create a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses such as partnerships, sole proprietorships and family farms.It would also lower the top individual tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while raising the bottom rate to 12 percent from 10 percent as it also doubles the standard deduction. The plan would eliminate many corporate “loopholes” and deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction. But it would also get rid of many provisions that are currently costly to the rich, like the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.“It’s hard to see if you continue to have those provisions in a tax proposal that it doesn’t benefit high income individuals and households disproportionately,” said Mark J. Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center and a former assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department.Eliminating some of the more costly tax measures would make it impossible for Republicans to enact the deep cuts to tax rates that they are trying to achieve. Repealing personal exemptions, which diminishes the impact of doubling the standard deduction, for example, raises $1.5 trillion. Getting rid of the state and local deduction raises $1.3 trillion in revenue over 10 years."
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Friday that American-led international sanctions were causing “colossal” damage in the impoverished country, but added that it would be foolish for Washington to think the sanctions would stop the country’s nuclear weapons programs.North Korean officials recently set up a committee to investigate the damage that the sanctions have caused on the country’s economy and the well-being of the population. The committee’s work was designed to draw international sympathy by highlighting the suffering of North Korean children, women and elderly people, analysts said.The sanctions are “a brutal criminal act that indiscriminately infringes upon the right to existence of the peaceful civilians,” said a spokesman of the Sanctions Damage Investigation Committee in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday. “The colossal amount of damage caused by these sanctions to the development of our state and the people’s livelihood is beyond anyone’s calculation.”The North Korean statement came after President Trump’s executive order last week, which strengthened his administration’s authority to target foreign banks that facilitate trade with North Korea. On Tuesday, the United States added eight North Korean banks to its sanctions blacklist.On Thursday, China said it would close business joint ventures with North Korea within 120 days, in accordance with the latest United Nations sanctions.North Korea has endured sanctions for decades, devising ways to circumvent them.The unidentified North Korean spokesman said on Friday that it was “a foolish dream to hope that the sanctions could work” on North Korea after they had failed to stop it from becoming a nuclear weapons state.After North Korea’s recent nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, the Trump administration is strengthening its campaign to squeeze North Korea financially while warning that military action is also on the table.“We call on all countries to join us in cutting all trade and financial ties with North Korea,” acting Assistant Secretary Susan A. Thornton told a Senate committee on Thursday.Ms. Thornton said the United States had “no desire to inflict harm on the long-suffering North Korean people, whom we view as distinct from the hostile regime in Pyongyang.” But she said sanctions were working and urged the world to rigorously enforce them.In its two recent rounds of sanctions adopted on Aug. 5 and Sept. 11, respectively, the United Nations Security Council sought to ban critical North Korean exports, like textiles, coal, iron and seafood.In keeping with the sanctions, Kuwait, Qatar, Malaysia and Malta have stopped issuing visas to North Korean workers and are phasing out the use of these workers, whose wages helped finance the North Korean government and its nuclear and missile programs, Ms. Thornton said.Poland is the only country in Europe still hosting significant numbers of North Korean workers, she said, while the vast majority of North Korean laborers remaining outside of North Korea are in either China or Russia.China accounts for 90 percent of North Korea’s external trade. Experts say the sanctions won’t work without Chinese support, which Ms. Thornton called “growing, if uneven.”"
"WASHINGTON — President Trump took his push for deep tax cuts to a supportive audience of manufacturers on Friday, arguing that reducing levies on businesses will be “rocket fuel” to propel economic growth and ultimately translate to more jobs and better wages for American workers, as well.Still seeking a major first-year legislative victory after the latest failure of his bid to repeal and replace his predecessor’s health care system, Mr. Trump sought to rally business support for his tax package even as special-interest lobbyists already have begun mobilizing to save breaks and provisions threatened by the plan.“Under my administration, the era of economic surrender is over and the rebirth of American industry is beginning,” he said in a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers. “America is winning again and America is being respected again.” Arguing that most manufacturers will see their tax rates fall to levels not seen in many years, Mr. Trump said, “it will be rocket fuel for our economy.”For their part, Democrats hammered away at the plan, contending that it offered little relief for the middle class and would mainly benefit the wealthy, including Mr. Trump himself, who by one analysis could save $1 billion. A new video posted online by the Democratic National Committee summed up its side of the argument with the headline: “Trump’s tax plan = $1 billion for Trump, ‘zero’ for 1/3 of Americans.”The framework crafted by the administration with Republican lawmakers would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and create a new 25 percent rate for so-called pass-through businesses like partnerships and sole proprietorships that are currently taxed at the rate of their owners.About 95 percent of businesses in the United States are structured as pass-throughs, and they account for most of the corporate tax revenue paid to the government. Businesses would be allowed to deduct the full cost of new equipment in the first year rather than spread it out over time.For individual taxpayers, the plan would collapse the tax brackets to three from seven, lowering rates for many while doubling the standard deduction and increasing the child tax credit. It would eliminate the tax on estates larger than $5.49 million for individuals and about $11 million for couples, while canceling the alternative minimum tax, which is meant to ensure that the wealthiest still pay but has increasingly affected middle-class taxpayers as well. To offset some of the cost, it would cancel deductions for state and local income taxes.Mr. Trump said the net effect would be “a giant, beautiful, massive — the biggest ever in our country — tax cut” and called on business to press Congress to pass it. “With your help and your voice, we will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our wealth, and for every citizen across this land we will bring back our great American dream,” Mr. Trump told the audience of manufacturing executives gathered at a Washington hotel.As he has done before, Mr. Trump exaggerated the economic progress made on his watch. He noted correctly that economic growth reached 3.1 percent in the second quarter of the year, but then asserted that America had not seen such growth in “a very, very long time.” In fact, the economy was growing that fast as recently as the start of 2015 and, since 2009, every year but one saw at least one quarter with even higher growth.But in addressing the manufacturers association, Mr. Trump was preaching to the choir. The group said a survey of its members found that most reported that a package of tax cuts would make them more likely to expand their business, hire more workers and increase wages and benefits. The group’s survey found that over the past nine months, 91 percent felt optimistic about the outlook for their businesses, the highest three-quarter average in its 20-year history.“Today’s tax code lets other countries win, and our workers and our families are paying the price and we have an obligation to speak out,” said Jay Timmons, the association’s president. “It’s time to go big, it’s time to go bold — and manufacturers are grateful to have a president who agrees.”"
"BEIJING — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is scheduled to arrive in Beijing early Saturday for a brief visit, amid confusing signals about President Trump’s position on two questions looming over the confrontation with North Korea: Is America’s long-term goal to overthrow its leader, Kim Jong-un, or just try to change his behavior? And what would it take to get negotiations with Pyongyang started?Mr. Tillerson, who is confronting a problem for which his background as chief executive of Exxon Mobil is of little help, has tried to reassure North Korea with his oft-repeated assertion that “we do not seek the collapse of the regime.” But Mr. Kim, and the Chinese, appear to be trying to square those calming words with President Trump’s tweets, including the ominous-sounding one he issued last weekend, warning that if the North’s foreign minister echoes the thinking of “Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer.”Similarly, Chinese officials are likely to scrutinize Mr. Tillerson to see if he is willing — or able — to provide clarity about the contradictory statements issued by top national security officials over the conditions under which American officials would actually talk with the North Koreans. Mr. Tillerson himself has been inconsistent, insisting months ago that Mr. Kim must first give up all his weapons, then arguing in August that he must simply pause their nuclear and missile testing.But last week Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, insisted that the North would have to agree to highly intrusive inspections to determine the whereabouts of its nuclear weapons, and agree to ultimately plan to surrender its arsenal. The North has never allowed inspectors far beyond its Yongbyon reactor facility, and its arsenal is now enshrined in its Constitution as something no official could ever trade away.For Mr. Tillerson, who has only been in Beijing once before as secretary of state — months before a direct confrontation seemed as imaginable as it is today — the opportunity to truly change the dynamic seems slim.His arrival was delayed by a maintenance issue with the secretary of state’s aging plane, and he found himself forced to overnight in Tokyo. He is to arrive here Saturday, under the current plan, just as many in Beijing are streaming out for a weeklong national holiday. His host, President Xi Jinping, is consumed by the country’s 19th Communist Party congress, which starts Oct. 18 and is seen as the moment for him to further consolidate his power.Mr. Xi is clearly as worried about the North Koreans disrupting the party congress as the United States. There are rumors of new missile tests, though it seems highly unlikely that the North is yet prepared to attempt an atmospheric nuclear blast, which would be the first in 37 years by any nation. The specter of the North setting off a potential environmental disaster would at a minimum embarrass Mr. Xi, and perhaps force his hand to invoke sanctions that could destabilize the regime, a step China has always refused to take.“Xi doesn’t want any distractions,” Michael J. Green, a former senior American diplomat who now teaches about East Asia at Georgetown University, said at a forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Tuesday. “Particularly from the North Koreans.”So in recent days the Chinese have done just enough to hold Mr. Tillerson off for a number of months. They have announced a series of new financial rules that, after the letter of the latest round of United Nations sanctions, should make it all but impossible for Chinese financial institutions to do business with North Korea, at least in any visible way.North Korean officials recently set up a committee to investigate the impact of the sanctions on the country’s economy and the well-being of the population. The committee’s work was designed to draw international sympathy by highlighting the suffering of North Korean children, women and elderly people, analysts said.The sanctions are “a brutal criminal act that indiscriminately infringes upon the right to existence of the peaceful civilians,” said a spokesman of the Sanctions Damages Investigation Committee in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday. “The colossal amount of damage caused by these sanctions to the development of our state and the people’s livelihood is beyond anyone’s calculation.”On Thursday, the Chinese commerce ministry said North Korean ventures and joint ventures in China had to close within 120 days of the Sept. 11 approval of the latest Security Council sanctions. Some energy supplies have been cut, though the Chinese managed to kill a much tougher American proposal at the United Nations to cut off all crude oil to the North, and allow shipping in and out of the country to be inspected by force, if necessary.“China has taken some great strides in recent weeks, and we look forward to China adhering to the U.N. Security Council resolutions and fully implementing all those resolutions,” Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday. “I think the secretary will be thanking them for the steps that they’ve taken in that direction.”But when not speaking for attribution, virtually no American officials — including Trump administration appointees and diplomats who have dealt with North Korea in the past — believe that any escalation of sanctions will do more than temporarily slow the nuclear program.“They have no intention of giving it up,” Sue Mi Terry, a former North Korea analyst for the C.I.A. and now a consultant on Korea issues for BowerGroupAsia, said earlier this week in Washington. But it is an exercise both the United States and China must go through, she said, until the United States decides whether it is simply going to live with North Korea’s status as a nuclear state whose weapons can reach American shores.Mr. Trump insists he will never live with that threat, and says that is what separates him from the past four American presidents. He promises to “solve” the North Korean problem once and for all, after being left “a mess” by his predecessors.But, apart from his martial sounding tweets and his assurances that the military is prepared to destroy North Korea at his command, he is staying vague about what a solution looks like. One senior aide said recently that in internal debates, there is an assumption that the problem cannot be solved with Mr. Kim still in power, but acknowledged that the United States has no understanding of whether a successor would be better or worse.For his part, Mr. Tillerson, though hired for his ability to strike deals, has never talked about what the United States would give North Korea in return. There is speculation about a quiet agreement with the North to scale back military exercises. It is doubtful that alone would impress Mr. Kim as he nears the completion of his national mission, a weapon that can reach the United States.But doing so would require some channel of communication, overt or covert. Asked earlier this week about whether there were any contacts with the North, General McMaster said no, then quickly left the door open to doing exactly that.“When we do,” he said, “hopefully it will not make it into The New York Times.”Chinese officials keep discussing a so-called freeze for freeze, in which Mr. Kim gives up nuclear and missile tests and the United States gives up its exercises. But both Mr. Tillerson and General McMaster have rejected that step, arguing that to do it now, with the North’s weapons and delivery systems so advanced, would be to acknowledge the North as a nuclear power, even if there was vague talk of eventually reaching an accord over the ultimate status of the North’s weapons.Lurking beneath that conversation is another that the United States has consistently tried, and failed, to engage in with the Chinese: a secret discussion over how to plan for a collapse of the North Korean government, when there may be only hours, or days, to scramble for control of the country’s well-hidden nuclear arsenal.It is a topic the Chinese do not want to discuss and have always avoided, for fear news of the discussion would leak, and it would look as if Beijing were plotting either to abandon or take over the North. Now, some senior American officials say, the subject can no longer be avoided, because if a conflict breaks out, there will be no time to discuss it later."
"WASHINGTON — It started as a medical mystery. It then was determined to have been the result of a mysterious attack. And on Friday, the illness that has affected 21 diplomats at the American Embassy in Havana, with symptoms including hearing loss and cognitive difficulties, threatened the future of Cuban-American relations.With no guarantee that the Cuban government could protect American diplomats, the State Department announced that it was withdrawing all nonessential personnel from the embassy.In a statement, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson repeated the American assertion that the embassy personnel were deliberately targeted. But he did not blame Cuba, and officials held out the possibility that a third party might have been responsible. “Cuba has told us it will continue to investigate these attacks, and we will continue to cooperate with them in this effort,” Mr. Tillerson said.But the Trump administration, which has already expelled two Cuban diplomats over the illnesses, is considering further retaliatory steps, according to Congressional staff briefed by administration officials. And the State Department issued an advisory that Americans should not travel to Cuba. Because some of the attacks occurred in hotels where State Department employees were temporarily staying, officials said they worried that tourists and others could be affected.The Cuban government responded with dismay while promising to continue to cooperate in the investigation, calling Friday’s decision “hasty” and one that “will affect the bilateral relations.”While there is no evidence so far that tourists or hotel employees have been affected, the government’s travel warning could cripple Cuba’s burgeoning tourism industry if tour operators, hotel and cruise line companies or their insurers decide that their employees and customers could be at risk.“Right now, the most important constituency of determining the impact of this is not members of Congress or pundits; it’s the insurance companies,” said John Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. “If the carriers withdraw coverage because of this warning, then everything could shut down there almost overnight.”The timing of Mr. Tillerson’s decision and its potential fallout promises to write yet another chapter in an extraordinary history between the two countries that has included the explosion of the American battleship Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898, the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.Then, in 2014, after decades of frosty relations, constant sniping and severed diplomatic relations, President Barack Obama reversed course and reached an agreement with President Raúl Castro of Cuba to reopen embassies in the countries’ respective capitals and begin to encourage nascent tourism and business ties.But the rapprochement was deeply unpopular among a powerful segment of Cuban émigrés in Florida, and Mr. Trump in his campaign vowed to reverse what he called a “terrible and misguided deal.” Once in office, Mr. Trump did undo crucial pieces of Mr. Obama’s policy, but kept in place others that were broadly popular, such as allowing direct flights and cruises between the United States and Cuba, and rules making it easier for American companies to do business in Cuba.On Capitol Hill, a debate began immediately over whether Mr. Tillerson acted too quickly or not quickly enough. He has known since a few days after his confirmation on Feb. 1 that diplomats in Havana were becoming ill, but took until Friday to reduce the diplomatic and Marine Corps contingent there to 27.Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who fiercely opposed Mr. Obama’s decision to improve ties with Cuba, questioned the decision not to punish Cuba more forcefully.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said punitive measures would only play into the hands of the attackers. “Whoever is doing this obviously is trying to disrupt the normalization process between the United States and Cuba,” Mr. Leahy said. “Someone or some government is trying to reverse that process.”A host of Latin American scholars denounced the State Department’s travel advisory as a cynical ploy to undo the last vestiges of the Obama administration’s rapprochement with Cuba. “The fact remains that Cuba is the safest place in Latin America for foreigners to visit,” said Eric Zolov, a Cuban expert at Stony Brook University. “Crime is exceptionally low and tourism is coveted by the government.”President Trump was unapologetic about the action on Friday, saying that “some very bad things happened in Cuba.”But one reason Mr. Tillerson decided to keep the embassy open is a growing belief among American officials that the Cuban government was probably not responsible for them.A former senior American official said that there was information that the Cubans were rattled by what had happened and were desperate to find the cause. The fact that a Canadian diplomat was also affected has deepened the mystery. Relations between Canada and Cuba have long been warm.The former senior official said that F.B.I. agents who had been allowed entry to Cuba had visited the homes of the American diplomats and had not been able to detect anything. The F.B.I. has also reviewed security footage of the homes and found nothing suspicious, and the agency has been unable to duplicate the effects the diplomats have experienced in a lab.That the Cubans offered to let the F.B.I. go to Havana and investigate was a rare level of openness and was seen as yet another indicator that the Cubans themselves have been shaken by the episode.Of the 21 people who have become ill, 17 were government employees and four were spouses. Three of the spouses worked at the embassy. For some, the injuries appear permanent, with symptoms including hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, balance and visual problems, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues and difficulty sleeping. But despite an intensive investigation by the F.B.I., the cause and perpetrators of the attacks remain a mystery.Some of those affected reported hearing odd sounds in particular rooms of their homes, leading some experts to speculate that some kind of sonic weapon or faulty surveillance device may have been at fault.“Just looking at the symptoms, it sounds like they’ve all had traumatic brain injuries like a concussion or a series of minor head injuries even though we know they haven’t,” said Dr. Martin Gizzi, a neurologist in Portland, Ore., who is a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.Dr. Gizzi said neither ultrasonic nor subsonic waves have been known to produce such injuries surreptitiously. Among the other possibilities are a virus, poison or radiation, he said.Friday’s announcement came three days after Mr. Tillerson met with Bruno Rodríguez, Cuba’s foreign minister, in Washington, in a meeting that the Cuban government requested. That meeting did not convince Mr. Tillerson that the Cubans could guarantee the safety of the remaining American employees in Havana, prompting the decision to pull much of the embassy staff.The remaining staff will carry out only emergency services, such as helping American citizens in need. Routine visa functions for Cuban citizens will no longer be conducted in Havana. Officials may soon direct Cubans seeking to travel to the United States to apply for visas at embassies or consulates in other countries.American officials will continue to meet with their Cuban counterparts — but not in Cuba — until the cause of the attacks is uncovered, officials said.In August, Heather Nauert, the State Department’s spokeswoman, said that the department was confident that the attacks were no longer occurring. But on Friday, officials conceded that the remaining 27 personnel in Havana were still at risk."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to travel to Asia in November for the longest overseas journey of his presidency to date as he seeks to build a common front against North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, the White House announced on Friday.Mr. Trump will travel to five Asian nations from Nov. 3-14, including three critical to the crisis over North Korea — Japan, South Korea and China. He will also stop in the Philippines, whose authoritarian leader Mr. Trump has embraced for his antidrug campaign despite extrajudicial killings, and in Vietnam, which is still smarting over his decision to abandon a free-trade pact.“President Trump will discuss the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific region to America’s prosperity and security,” the administration said in a statement. “He will also emphasize the importance of fair and reciprocal economic ties with America’s trade partners. The president’s engagements will strengthen the international resolve to confront the North Korean threat and ensure the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”Presidents typically travel to the Pacific region in the late fall because of two international summit meetings held by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, both of which Mr. Trump will attend. But the 12-day trip will tax a president who does not particularly relish overseas travel and who thought a weeklong trip earlier in the year was too long.North Korea has come to dominate his foreign policy agenda as the outlier state has tested intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the United States and conducted its sixth nuclear test.The rhetoric has escalated as Mr. Trump has vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if forced to defend the United States or its allies and has mocked its leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Little Rocket Man.” Mr. Kim has responded by calling Mr. Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” and his government has threatened to conduct an atmospheric nuclear test, which would be the first the world has seen in 37 years.While rattling sabers, Mr. Trump for the moment has stuck to a strategy of increasing economic pressure and strengthening regional solidarity. He hosted the leaders of Japan and South Korea at the United Nations and spoke by phone with the leader of China earlier this month even as he ordered a sweeping new set of sanctions intended to cut North Korea off from the international banking system.His trip will be his first to Asia since taking office and will be flavored by other tensions. In one of his first acts as president, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama had negotiated to create a 12-nation free trade zone; three of the nations he will visit were part of that pact: Vietnam, South Korea and Japan. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly threatened trade action against China, which he accuses of cheating the United States, and vowed to withdraw from a trade deal with South Korea unless it is renegotiated.Mr. Trump’s stop in the Philippines will also draw heavy notice, especially from human rights groups that denounce the practices of President Rodrigo Duterte, whose government has sanctioned deadly attacks on drug suspects. Thousands of people have died in extrajudicial killings without arrest or trial, according to human rights groups, and the State Department has criticized what it called the “apparent governmental disregard for human rights and due process.”While Mr. Obama snubbed Mr. Duterte, Mr. Trump has embraced him. In a telephone call in April, he praised Mr. Duterte’s “unbelievable job on the drug problem,” according to a transcript produced by the Philippine government. “Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that,” the transcript recorded him saying."
"President Trump proposed a sweeping plan to cut taxes on Wednesday that included the elimination of the estate tax and big cuts to corporate tax rates.Below, we’ve selected a variety of differing perspectives on the plan from across the political spectrum. And you can get caught up on what exactly is (and isn’t) in Mr. Trump’s tax cut plan here. For our editorial board’s perspective on the proposal, click here.Has this series exposed you to new ideas? Tell us how. Email us at ourpicks@nytimes.com.For an archive of all the Partisan Writing Roundups, check out Our Picks.Ramesh Ponnuru in National Review:The tax proposal put forward by the Trump administration increases the child tax credit from $1,000 to some unspecified amount. That lack of detail, argues Mr. Ponnuru, is a pretty crucial piece of information to understanding how the proposal would affect most families. Luckily, he writes, “Republicans have plenty of time to fix this problem.” Read more »_____Bruce Bartlett in The Washington Post:Mr. Bartlett served as a domestic policy director for President Ronald Reagan, in whose administration he helped design the 1981 tax cut that “unleashed the American economy and led to an abundance of growth.” Since then, “tax cuts became the G.O.P.’s go-to solution for nearly every economic problem,” when “in reality,” he writes, there is “no evidence that a tax cut now would spur growth.” Read more »_____Philip Klein in The Washington Examiner: Mr. Klein outlines three missing pieces of information needed to assess the effect on households: by how much the child credit will increase, which income groups can claim these credits and what the income cutoffs are for the new tax brackets. “Without more details, it’s impossible to say how middle-class families would make out,” he writes. Read more »_____Amelie Ratliff in The Guardian:Ms. Ratliff is a member of a group called the Patriotic Millionaires, whose website describes its members as “high-net worth Americans, business leaders, and investors who are united in their concern about the destabilizing concentration of wealth and power in America.” She argues that millionaires like herself don’t deserve another tax break in this “time of staggering inequality.” One key to fighting inequality is a progressive tax system that includes the estate tax that Mr. Trump’s plan eliminates. Read more »_____Seth Hanlon in Fortune: Mr. Hanlon served as a special assistant to President Barack Obama for economic policy at the White House National Economic Council. He explains how Mr. Trump’s proposal to cut the tax rate for pass-through corporations would be a financial boon for Mr. Trump himself. “Through the Trump Organization, Trump owns more than 500 pass-through business entities,” he writes. “His new loophole would slash the tax rate on the profits from these entities by more than a third.” Read more »_____Jared Bernstein in American Prospect: Tax reform, Mr. Bernstein reminds his readers, has come to connote something positive: closing loopholes, “cutting tax rates and broadening the tax base.” What the Republicans are pushing for, however, are tax cuts, not reform. Real tax reform, he argues, “must offset, not exacerbate, market-driven inequalities, and it must raise the necessary revenue to meet the many challenges we face.” And, in the spirit of offering a “good, crisp, resonant answer” to the problem of tax reform, Mr. Bernstein outlines a progressive tax reform plan that includes eliminating “wasteful tax expenditures” and adding a “minimum tax on foreign earnings.” Read more »_____Justin Fox in Bloomberg:Mr. Fox explains why the pass-through tax cut is a “boondoggle.” He argues that there’s an “admirable elegance” to “running everything through the personal income tax code.” That elegance is sullied by “subjecting pass-through owners to a different, lower tax rate” than that of the corporate tax. Read more »_____The editorial board of USA Today:The members of USA Today’s editorial board are concerned about two aspects of Mr. Trump’s tax proposal. The first is the additional debt — by some estimates more than $2 trillion — incurred by an economy that “doesn’t need this sort of borrowing-fueled fiscal stimulus.” The second, and “most egregious provision” of the plan, is an end to the estate tax. They ask, “Why should inherited wealth receive a more privileged status than wealth accumulated through work or entrepreneurship?” Read more »_____Want the Partisan Writing Roundup in your inbox?

"As the final, frenzied week of spring ready-to-wear shows began in the French capital, the country’s most influential stylist was nowhere to be found.He wouldn’t be in the front row (he never attends the shows). He might not even be in town. And even if he were, he would make a point of staying below the radar.Now that stylists are media stars in their own right, that’s a rare situation. Consider the surging profile of the self-described illusionist Arianne Phillips, the costume designer for Katy Perry, Madonna, “Kingsman” and more. Or that of Karla Welch, who has engineered red carpet looks for Elisabeth Moss, Ruth Negga and Sarah Paulson as well as Justin Bieber and Lorde.But as the stylist that Brigitte Macron — the first lady of France, one of the inspirations for the new acronym WHIP (“women who are hot, intelligent and in their prime”) — enlisted, Mathieu Barthelat Colin has somewhat different priorities.Powerful public relations executives deny knowing him (if they even return an inquiring call). Ask in person and they change the subject. Designers whose clothes the first lady has worn are quick to say they have never met him, either (they’re dying to, obviously). Locate a willing intermediary and Mr. Barthelat, as he is known, will decline — politely, firmly, repeatedly — to be interviewed. Like Meredith Koop, the stylist to Michelle Obama from 2009 to 2016, he prefers life behind the scenes.Even online, he hasn’t left many traces. Aside from references to long-ago stints in the communications departments at midlevel brands like Zadig & Voltaire, Cerruti and Loft Design By, scant details turn up in a Google search. On Instagram, Mr. Barthelat is more inclined to post scenes of his home in Burgundy than anything fashion-related.It’s as if the 34-year-old materialized out of nowhere when, in June, the website of the French magazine Gala posted a video in which the tall, dashing, bearded stylist was shown (for a couple of seconds) helping a candidate for the French version of “The Bachelor” into a white jacket. Compared with the bachelor, Mr. Barthelat, who was wearing a white oxford shirt and gray V-neck sweater, was noticeably ill at ease in front of the camera. He has also dressed both jury members and candidates for the French version of “The Voice” in a mix of styles and price ranges.But reality TV is not what paved his way to the Élysée Palace.Mr. Barthelat recognized Mrs. Macron at the theater late last year, before she became a media darling. In a fan moment, he worked up the courage to introduce himself. The call came shortly thereafter.Mrs. Macron’s style has always skewed less-is-more. Judging by her public appearances since they began working together this year, Mr. Barthelat’s influence has been both subtle and significant.The first lady has been loyal to Louis Vuitton, wearing designs by its artistic director, Nicolas Ghesquière, a friend whose runway shows she attended before becoming a public figure. Other classic French names in her wardrobe include Balmain, Courrèges and Dior.But recently she has also taken to wearing sharp jackets by lesser known designers and labels: Alexandre Vauthier (in red or black), Stéfanie Renoma (powder blue) and the tailoring specialist Pallas (beige, at the G20 meeting in July in Hamburg, Germany), the better to cast a halo around a larger group of French names.And it’s not just about high fashion. Jewel-neck tops and other separates by midrange French brands like ba&sh, Sandro, Georges Rech and Paule Ka have appeared in the mix. On a state visit to Greece in September she was spotted wearing a Greek-coin “Profile” ring by Marc Auclert, whose designs incorporate antique artifacts and who is one of the few designers willing to discuss the effect of her favor.“For an unknown designer like me, it’s wonderful to be in the spotlight,” Mr. Auclert said, “but at the same time it’s not about the brand. It’s brainier than that.“Mrs. Macron epitomizes the 21st-century woman, particularly because of her intellect. That’s the new generation. That’s Mathieu. His service is all about excellence and expertise. It’s so much more interesting than being a name brand. He’s the key.”Like everyone else, Mr. Auclert said he would love to meet Mr. Barthelat one day."
"NEWARK — “Unusual.” “Odd.” “Just different.”Those were some of the ways prosecution witnesses on Thursday described the actions taken by Senator Robert Menendez and his aides on behalf of a wealthy friend and political donor.Federal prosecutors say that in exchange for Mr. Menendez’s help, the friend, Dr. Salomon Melgen, an ophthalmologist in Florida, provided Mr. Menendez with lavish gifts, including rides on his private planes, rooms in luxury hotels and hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to the senator’s campaign efforts.Senator Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Dr. Melgen are on trial here on corruption charges. Both men have denied any wrongdoing.Prosecutors have sought to portray the senator as abusing his position to intervene when Dr. Melgen had concerns he needed addressed.In one instance, Mr. Menendez, according to testimony, met with two former high-ranking Democratic senators — Tom Harkin of Iowa and Harry Reid of Nevada — to discuss a Medicare billing dispute that would have cost Dr. Melgen millions of dollars. In a second, prosecution witnesses said he pressured the State Department and Customs and Border Protection officials to help Dr. Melgen, who owned a cargo-scanning equipment company, maintain his business’s presence at ports in the Dominican Republic.In particular, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez urged Customs and Border Protection to stop a donation of cargo-scanning equipment from the United States government that would have cut into Dr. Melgen’s profits.“It’s somewhat unusual to have a senator or a member of Congress to ask us to stop — in a way, stop doing our law enforcement mission,” Stephanie Talton, a former congressional liaison for Customs and Border Protection, testified. Ms. Talton had received an email from an aide to Mr. Menendez asking her to “please consider holding off on the delivery of any such equipment until you can discuss this matter with us.”“If we had deemed that it was necessary to provide this equipment to do our law enforcement mission,” Ms. Talton said, “I found it odd that a senator would tell us to stop doing that.”Prosecutors on Thursday frequently returned to Mr. Menendez’s membership on various Senate committees. In questioning Todd Robinson, the current United States ambassador to Guatemala, who worked under the ambassador to the Dominican Republic at the time Dr. Melgen was involved in the port dispute, prosecutors highlighted Mr. Menendez’s seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which Mr. Robinson said held sway over the State Department.Mr. Menendez warned that he would convene a Senate hearing, Mr. Robinson testified, if the State Department did not help Dr. Melgen resolve a contract dispute between the Dominican government and Dr. Melgen’s company.“The senator noted displeasure very clearly with the current state of affairs and threatened to hold a hearing on the matter if we don’t meet his deadline,” a State Department official wrote in an email to Mr. Robinson.Mr. Robinson conceded that it was not unusual for members of Congress to request assistance on behalf of American businesses abroad. But when government lawyers asked how many of those requests involved threats of Senate hearings, he replied, “None that I know of.”Mr. Robinson added, “It was not likely to be a friendly hearing, because you have the word threat in the email.”The government’s questions framed Mr. Menendez’s actions as not merely acts of friendship, or typical work on behalf of constituents, as defense lawyers have argued. Instead, they seemed carefully calibrated to show that the meetings and conversations the senator arranged were “official acts,” the bar that the United States Supreme Court has recently established must be met for actions by elected officials to rise to the level of corruption.Lawyers for Mr. Menendez focused on the semantics of the request from his aide, pointing out words like “please” and “consider” as proof that the senator had not intended to give any sort of command.“It started off with ‘please,’ correct?” Raymond Brown, a defense lawyer, asked Ms. Talton, the Customs and Border Protection liaison. “And we understand that to be a word of entreaty, not direction, correct?”But Amanda Vaughn, a federal prosecutor, pressed Ms. Talton to explain why an entreaty from Mr. Menendez, also a member of the Senate Finance Committee, might hold more weight than a request from other senators.“When something like that comes from a staffer for a member that sits on a committee as powerful to us as the Senate Finance Committee, it’s just a polite way of telling us what to do,” Ms. Talton said, explaining that the committee has oversight of her agency.Another witness, Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, also alluded to actions by Mr. Menendez involving Dr. Melgen’s Medicare dispute. Mr. Menendez had met with Dr. Melgen and Mr. Harkin, the former senator from Iowa, to discuss millions of dollars Dr. Melgen had been accused of overbilling Medicare. Ms. Krishnamoorthy, a former aide to Mr. Harkin, said she could think of only one other time in her 10 years of working for Mr. Harkin that another senator had asked to meet with her boss on behalf of someone who did not live in his state.“It just was different,’’ she said. “It wasn’t for a constituent.”The other instance, Ms. Krishnamoorthy said, was when another senator asked Mr. Harkin to discuss research on a rare disease that the senator’s grandchild had been found to have.“But in that instance, it was the senator’s grandchild,” the prosecutor repeated.“Correct,” Ms. Krishnamoorthy replied.After court Thursday, Mr. Menendez held a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport, where he planned to board a flight to travel to Puerto Rico to survey the damage wrought by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. He would return Friday evening or Saturday morning, his spokesman said.The presiding judge, William H. Walls, had previously denied Mr. Menendez’s lawyers’ requests to delay the trial so that he could go to Congress to cast votes.Mr. Menendez called on President Trump to deploy more resources to the island, where his brother lives.“I hope that I will be able to go back to the Senate, since we’re having a short week here in Newark, and in doing so press some of this with my colleagues, as I have been doing on the phone,” he said."
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Thursday to step up its assistance to Puerto Rico more than a week after Hurricane Maria, appointing a three-star general to coordinate with agencies and vowing to give the island all it needed as aides tried to stave off comparisons to the response to Hurricane Katrina more than a decade ago.But on Puerto Rico, the desperation and frustration only grew. Shelters ran out of supplies and residents lined up all night to purchase ice and fuel, only to walk away with a bag of cold water or just a few gallons of gas. Others complained of an absence of basics like tarps for roofs and the continuing lack of running water.Officials still struggled to get supplies out of port to be distributed across an island of 3.4 million people where there is no electricity and scant phone service. Hospitals ran low on diesel for generators.The island has become a landscape of long lines and growing impatience with the pace of the response to what Puerto Rico’s governor called the “greatest catastrophe” in its modern history. Lawmakers and local officials alike called on President Trump to place the military in charge and to send more troops, aircraft and ships.“With all the needs there are, we go out every day to the streets and are face to face with the people — you don’t see a single government agency,” said Elizabeth Perez, a police officer in Ponce, P.R., who recently visited poor neighborhoods in her district and found people living in dire conditions.The White House continued to insist that the administration was doing all that it could. A century-old shipping law was temporarily waived after officials in Puerto Rico said it was hindering disaster relief efforts. About 7,200 troops are on the island, as are about 2,800 federal relief workers, the White House said. And the Pentagon announced that a new, higher-ranking military commander, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan of the Army, would work with federal aid agencies on the response.“We will not let you down,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told Puerto Ricans.“FEMA & First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico. Massive food & water delivered,” the president tweeted.But the call for more help grew increasingly urgent. “There is a crisis in Puerto Rico,” tweeted Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. “Fuel, water & medicine sitting at the docks. Need immediate response by US military. Where is the cavalry?”Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, who is being tried on federal bribery charges, criticized the response after court proceedings. Speaking at Newark Liberty International Airport, where he planned to board a flight to Florida and then one to Puerto Rico, Mr. Menendez called on the president to issue a disaster declaration for the entire island — which, he said, “astonishingly, has yet to happen.”Military officials involved in past disaster responses said that help for Puerto Rico should have been ramped up much earlier. Russel L. Honoré, the retired lieutenant general appointed by a beleaguered President George W. Bush to take over the botched federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said the government needs to quickly move 50,000 troops to Puerto Rico.“They need to scale up,” said General Honoré, who was widely praised for turning around the response to Katrina. During that relief operation, he said, “I had 20,000 federal troops. Not federal workers, federal troops.”He added, “And Puerto Rico is bigger than Katrina.”Even improvements in Puerto Rico seemed to beget more complications.As officials tried to move more goods out of the main port in San Juan, the capital, they struggled to find drivers. Some trucking companies were low on diesel and had trouble acquiring more. Some drivers lost their homes in the hurricane, or simply could not be reached by phone.So the government put out a call for truckers to send a text message to a hotline or simply show up at the convention center in San Juan that has been converted into a command center for the government. Those who heeded the request were frustrated by what they found.“They’re not letting us move at all,” said Danny Custodio, 37, who stood in the atrium of the convention center with his cousin on Thursday afternoon. “We’re in a crisis. Just open up the port so I can get what I need to get and take it where I need to take it.”Officials said that some containers were sitting in the port because businesses, many still shuttered, were not in a position to receive supplies. Warehouses were damaged. And apart from generators, no power source was available to keep perishable goods cold.About 600 containers did leave the port on Wednesday, up from 450 a day earlier, said Omar Marrero, the executive director of the Puerto Rico Ports Authority. He said that he expected that as many as 1,200 could leave on Thursday.Throughout Puerto Rico, residents say they have yet to see their mayors distribute aid. In Ponce, people who waited overnight to buy an allotted two small bags of ice had to repeat the act each night because, without electricity, the previous day’s purchases had melted.Hector Marquéz, 66, said he goes to the ice line every day at 3 a.m. to be ready for its 7 a.m. opening. “Have you seen a single tarp over anyone’s house? People lost their roofs. Where are the tarps?” Mr. Marquéz said. “They haven’t brought anything here.”He rattled off a list of what he could not find: bottles of water, gas canisters to light stoves, food.“Whatever little bit you had is running out,” he said. “The trucks with food do not come. No trucks come with anything. You go to the supermarket, and it’s almost empty.”Officer Perez, in Ponce, said that people were in “inhumane conditions, almost without food, without drinking water.”She said that “when I went up in the police car, they said that in a week, this is the first agency that will come up here to see what the status is.”Some humanitarian aid still cannot even get to Puerto Rico.Freddy Rolon, 43, arrived Wednesday with fellow firefighters from Texas, but the donated water and other supplies that aid organizations had gathered were still in Florida, he said.“We have hundreds of containers that are full, ready to get to the island,” Mr. Rolon said. “All that is ready to deploy.”Administration officials conceded that the response appeared to be sluggish and inadequate, but they defended its efforts and blamed news media accounts for exaggerating the situation.“I understand the coverage, in some cases, is giving the appearance that we’re not moving fast enough,” Thomas P. Bossert, Mr. Trump’s homeland security adviser, told reporters outside the White House. He said there was “an understandable degree of devastation” and a sense that “there’s nothing that can happen fast enough.”“But what I will tell you is that we are mobilizing and marshaling the resources of the United States of America in a way that is absolutely professional, fast and adequate to meet the needs,” Mr. Bossert added.Later, at the daily White House briefing, Mr. Bossert deflected the criticism coming from elected officials and others by promising that they would be “blown away” when they saw “the full totality” of the United States government’s response.“This is textbook,” he insisted, “and it’s been done well.”Still, Mr. Bossert acknowledged that the administration has ramped up its efforts, recognizing that its initial steps were insufficient.The Army Corps of Engineers was put in charge of restoring power on the island. Administration officials also said that federal forces — active-duty military and National Guard and reservists — had joined officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.Patrick M. Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary, spoke by phone with Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico on Thursday and pledged that the Pentagon would “deploy all needed resources,” the Defense Department said in a statement.Of Mr. Trump’s planned visit next week to the island, Mr. Menendez said, “I’m glad he’s going to visit so that he gets a full amount of understanding.” But that understanding, he added, would come late, and after two other hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, lashed the United States.“Knowing that this was a Category Five hurricane after Irma — what did you expect on the island?” Mr. Menendez said."
"Otto F. Warmbier, the college student imprisoned in North Korea and returned to the United States in a vegetative state, suffered extensive brain damage following interrupted blood flow and a lack of oxygen, according to the coroner who examined his body.But an external examination and “virtual autopsy” conducted by the coroner’s office in Hamilton County, Ohio, could not determine how his circulation had been cut off.“All we can do is theorize, and we hate to theorize without science backing us up,” Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco, the county coroner, said in an interview Thursday.Mr. Warmbier, 22, an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, was convicted in March 2016 of trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a trip to North Korea and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was flown back to the United States in June in a vegetative state.North Korean officials said Mr. Warmbier’s condition was caused by sleeping pills and botulism, a diagnosis that medical experts doubted. He died six days later at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.His parents requested that a full autopsy not be performed. On Tuesday, during an appearance on the television show “Fox & Friends,” Fred Warmbier said that his son had been “tortured” and described North Korean officials as “terrorists.”After the interview, President Trump said in a tweet that Mr. Warmbier “was tortured beyond belief by North Korea.”On Thursday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement denying again that Mr. Warmbier had been tortured and accusing the United States of “employing even a dead person” in a “conspiracy campaign” against North Korea.Dr. Sammarco’s examination, which was concluded earlier this month, did not find signs of torture but could not rule out the possibility.“There are a lot of horrible things you can do to a human body that don’t leave external signs behind,” Dr. Sammarco said.“One of the frustrating things is the lack of information about what happened to him in North Korea,” she added.In a virtual autopsy, pathologists rely on an examination of the body and on scans to determine what has happened to it. Mr. Warmbier was returned with brain scans done in North Korea in April 2016 and again in July 2016.M.R.I. scans were done at the medical center after he arrived, which also performed a whole-body CT scan after Mr. Warmbier’s death.The images clearly showed that his brain had been starved of oxygen and that large tracts of cells had died, Dr. Sammarco said. The medical diagnosis is anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.That condition differs from the damage that occurs during a stroke, when a single blood vessel is blocked, said Dr. Lee H. Schwamm, executive vice chairman of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital.With an injury like Mr. Warmbier’s, “blood flow is reduced everywhere — the pump is turned off,” said Dr. Schwamm, who reviewed the coroner’s report at The Times’s request.In the United States, the most common cause is a cardiac arrest, often precipitated by a heart attack. While cardiac arrests are unlikely in healthy young men, they can happen if the victim is malnourished and suffers an imbalance of blood electrolytes, such as potassium, calcium, or magnesium, Dr. Schwamm said.The damage is quick: It takes just four minutes without blood for brain cells to start to die.Blood flow to the brain can be interrupted for any number of reasons. The whole-body CT scan did not find injuries associated with hanging, for example, but Dr. Schwamm said the evidence might not be visible if a bedsheet were used and the spine were not dislocated.Mr. Warmbier had a scar at the base of his neck that was probably caused by the insertion of a tube into his trachea as he was hooked up to a ventilator. This may indicate that he was not breathing on his own for a long period of time, Dr. Sammarco said.He was weaned from the ventilator in North Korea, though; he was not using it when he was returned.There were few other signs of injury on Mr. Warmbier’s body. There were no bedsores, and his skin condition was excellent, Dr. Sammarco said. “His muscle volume was pretty good for someone who was bedridden for over a year,” she said.In the United States, most families would opt for palliative care for a relative in a vegetative state resembling Mr. Warmbier’s, she added. That would consist of providing pain medications and sedatives to soothe them.Doctors do not know whether these patients suffer from pain and anxiety, Dr. Sammarco said. But they often groan and make jerky movements.The case has attracted global attention and inflamed international tensions. Dr. Sammarco said she offered to turn the examination over to federal authorities.“If there were national or international implications, we would be happy to relinquish jurisdiction and cooperate in any way necessary,” she said.Federal officials declined, she added."
"WASHINGTON — After being rebuked by President Trump for racking up at least $400,000 in travel on chartered flights, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said on Thursday that he would pay back taxpayers for his part of the bill and stop flying on private jets.But that does not mean his job is safe.Mr. Trump has grown incensed by Mr. Price’s liberal renting of expensive planes, which he views as undercutting his drain-the-swamp campaign message, according to several administration officials with direct knowledge of the president’s thinking. Through intermediaries and the media, Mr. Trump has let it be known that offering reimbursement as repentance was no guarantee that Mr. Price would keep his job.On Thursday, Mr. Price tried anyway.“I look forward to gaining, regaining the trust that the American people, some of the American people, may have lost in the activities that I took,” Mr. Price said in an appearance on “Special Report with Bret Baier” on Fox News.Mr. Price called Mr. Trump “a remarkable leader,” and said the president had expressed displeasure to him “very clearly.”With his job on the line, Mr. Price, a physician and former Georgia congressman, spent much of the day posing for photo ops — receiving his flu shot and attending a panel on the opioid crisis with first lady Melania Trump. In a statement, he expressed “regret” over the cost to taxpayers and said he would write a personal check to the Treasury to cover his expenses: “The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.”Mr. Price also said that he would cooperate with the department’s inspector general’s office on a review of his travel. The episode comes amid heightened scrutiny surrounding the pricey travel habits of several other cabinet members, including Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.But the president is said to have grown particularly frustrated with Mr. Price over the past week, as Politico published a series of reports detailing the secretary’s spending.The newspaper said Mr. Price took at least 26 flights on private jets, including to Nashville, where his son lives, and where Mr. Price owns a condominium, and to St. Simons Island, a Georgia resort area where Mr. Price owns property and recently spoke at a medical conference. Mr. Price also booked a charter  flight that included a leg to Philadelphia from Dulles International Airport in Virginia, a distance of about 130 miles. Mr. Price told Mr. Baier that all were undertaken with his agency’s approval.Mr. Baier pressed him on the cost of that travel — which Politico estimated at over $400,000, a number that has not been disputed — and asked why Mr. Price had only offered to pay back only $51,887. Mr. Price said that amount covers the cost of his seat on the trips, and the total bill remains under review.On Thursday night, Politico reported that the White House approved Mr. Price’s flying on United States military aircraft to travel to Europe, Asia and Africa for official events, at a cost of more than $500,000. The military flights were approved by Joe Hagin, a White House deputy chief of staff, an administration official confirmed, and Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said such travel “is sometimes an appropriate and necessary use of resources.”Combined, the total cost to taxpayers for Mr. Price’s flights comes to more than $1 million, according to Politico.In recent days, Mr. Trump fumed to senior aides about the negative headlines over Mr. Price’s travel and the damage it was personally causing the president, according to three officials with direct knowledge of the situation.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump rebuked Mr. Price for his travels. “I am not happy,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I’m going to look at it. I am not happy about it, and I let him know it.”The president’s anger has escalated over the past 24 hours, and has told at least one person close to him that he reserves the right to fire Mr. Price if new revelations come to light that reflect badly on Mr. Trump.Asked if Mr. Price’s job was in jeopardy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to comment, except to say, “We’ll see what happens.”Mr. Price’s announcement that he would reimburse the government for the cost of his seats on the private flights blindsided administration officials and raised questions about whether it was legal to do so, according to two people close to the White House. Additionally, one official said Mr. Price’s offer could set a precedent for others in the administration to repay their own travels.Mr. Price’s office responded with a statement from a spokeswoman, who said the secretary is in close contact with the White House: “He made this decision not because there was a legal responsibility, but because as he stated in his interview earlier today, he thought this was the right thing to do.”Mr. Mnuchin used a government jet for a trip to Kentucky that included viewing the Aug. 21 solar eclipse. And Mr. Pruitt has taken at least four noncommercial flights since February, at a cost of $58,000 to taxpayers, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.The travels by senior Trump administration officials — and their costs to taxpayers — have elicited a rare bipartisan outcry in Congress.Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, on Thursday introduced the Stop Waste and Misuse by Presidential Flyers Landing Yet Evading Rules and Standards (SWAMP FLYERS) Act. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, publicly urged Mr. Trump to curb the spending of cabinet secretaries, “considering the many travel options to and from Washington, D.C.”Mr. Price, who was already poised to shoulder some of the blame for the failed Graham-Cassidy health care effort, may have one main saving grace: Mr. Trump has few options of people who want his job, according to White House officials."
"Von Miller, a star linebacker for the Denver Broncos, was one of many N.F.L. players who knelt on Sunday during the playing of the national anthem in what became a sweeping and stark show of solidarity against police brutality and a silent admonition of President Trump.But the story this week, involving Miller and a Denver car dealership, offered a window into potential troubles for high-profile athletes and advertisers.It may also be a lesson in the dangers of jumping to conclusions in the age of viral news stories, internet mobs and instant boycotts. It was widely reported that a car dealership had fired Miller over his protest, but the facts turn out to be more complicated. The original TV news report has been retracted.Miller is among the N.F.L.’s highest-paid players and has done commercials for brands as well known as Old Spice.But it was a Denver car dealership that found itself at the center of a contract tussle that vaulted its name overnight into the national sports conversation.The situation arose Monday morning — just hours after Miller had taken the symbolic knee. At that time, KOAA-TV, which delivers news to Southern Colorado, reported that Miller had lost an endorsement deal with Phil Long Dealerships, specifically Phil Long Ford of Denver.The station later said it had based that on an email sent to media outlets on Monday by the advertising agency that represents Phil Long Dealerships. According to the station, the email said: “Please note ALL Von Miller ads needs to be removed. He is no longer a part of Phil Long.”The news report has been removed from KOAA’s website. But The Denver Post reported that the station had said the dealership dropped Miller’s endorsement “because of his protest.”Later on Monday, Robert Wilson, a spokesman for Vanguard Sports, which represents Miller, told the station that discussions were underway to renew the linebacker’s contract with the dealership but that the dealership said it had “decided not to move forward with the contract this year.”But he also said Miller had not had a deal in place for months, so the linebacker had not been “fired.” He declined to comment further Wednesday when reached by The New York Times.A statement released Monday by Phil Long Dealerships did little to clarify matters, saying the company had been “in the middle of contract renewal” with Miller and had not, in fact, “fired Von.”The statement seemed to both support Miller and express concern about how his conduct reflected on the business.“This weekend’s events remind us that sometimes we feel that we best represent ourselves,” said the statement, which was provided to The Times. “We support Von and his First Amendment rights, we know Von and he’s a good person. He donated a police car to his hometown police dept. All that notwithstanding when we bring in celebrities to represent us we run the risk of being misrepresented.”“While we can’t control the actions of others,” the statement continued, “we can be responsible for how we support our nation and community.”By Monday night, KOAA had posted a story saying it had erroneously reported that Miller had been fired, apologizing for what it called “a mistake.”By that time, Yelp users had descended onto the site to pillory Phil Long Ford of Denver for firing Miller. On Wednesday, Yelp added an alert that popped up on the dealership’s page noting that the business had “recently made waves in the news,” and that moderators would “work to remove both positive and negative posts that appear to be motivated more by the news coverage itself than the reviewer’s personal consumer experience with the business.”That cleanup process began on Wednesday, Yelp said, so several one-star reviews from earlier in the week remained on the company page as of Wednesday afternoon.“We’ve seen those,” Shawn Flynn, chief marketing officer at Phil Long Dealerships, said in a phone interview on Wednesday, “and we continue to respond to them as we see fit.”Since Monday, various media outlets have published stories about Miller and the dealership — most with slightly varying interpretations of what happened.Flynn maintained that Miller had not been fired and that the business and athlete were “in the middle of another contract negotiation as we speak.” Their previous endorsement contract had expired months ago, he said.Flynn also said Miller’s choice to kneel on Sunday had no effect on the dealership’s relationship with him.Asked later Wednesday whether it was true that the dealership had at some point “decided not to move forward” with contract negotiations, as Miller’s representative had contended on Monday, Flynn issued a second statement to The Times.That statement did not directly address the question, nor whether the public backlash had any effect on the company’s view of a future relationship with Miller.It reiterated that “Miller was never fired,” that he did not “lose an endorsement deal over a protest” and that there had been “consistent communication” with Miller’s agent about a deal.“On Monday morning, our dealership rotated different TV ads while we were discussing Sunday’s situation, however Von was and still is featured in a number of our marketing assets” the statement said, adding that “we look forward to continuing our discussions and working with him in the future.”"
"WASHINGTON — Justice Neil M. Gorsuch addressed a conservative group at the Trump International Hotel on Thursday, drawing protests and criticism for speaking at a venue that is the subject of several lawsuits against the president.In his remarks, Justice Gorsuch called for civility in debates over public controversies. On the one hand, he said, the First Amendment guarantees that “Americans can say pretty much anything they want for more or less any reason they want more or less anytime they want.”“But with every right comes a correlative responsibility,” he said. “And to be worthy of our First Amendment freedoms, we have to all adopt certain civil habits that enable others to enjoy them as well. When it comes to the First Amendment, that means tolerate those who don’t agree with us or those whose ideas upset us, giving others the benefit of the doubt about their motives.”Some experts in legal ethics and many liberal groups questioned the wisdom and prudence of Justice Gorsuch’s decision to speak at the hotel. Several lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of foreign payments to companies controlled by President Trump.“It’s disappointing that Justice Gorsuch agreed to speak at President Trump’s hotel, when Trump’s failure to adequately divest his hotels and other assets creates unconstitutional conflicts of interest that could very well end up before the court,” said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which represents lawmakers suing Mr. Trump.“Justice Gorsuch told the Senate during his confirmation that he was committed to the independence and integrity of the judiciary,” Ms. Wydra said, “but the decision to speak at an event that profits the president sadly falls far short of that standard.”Mr. Trump appointed Justice Gorsuch to fill the vacancy created by the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland, leaving the seat empty for more than a year.Justice Gorsuch’s remarks on Thursday, which also touched on constitutional history and the work of the Supreme Court, were the keynote address of a lunch to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fund for American Studies, which says it supports “principles of limited government, free-market economics and honorable leadership” through academic and fellowship programs.Before Justice Gorsuch spoke, Roger Ream, the group’s president, told the audience that he had been surprised by the controversy over the location of the lunch, adding that politics had played no role in the choice.In November, Justice Gorsuch will speak at a black-tie dinner at the annual convention of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group that helped compile lists of candidates to replace Justice Scalia. Justice Gorsuch’s name appeared on one of those lists.Last week, Justice Gorsuch made appearances in Kentucky with Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, who led the effort to block Judge Garland’s nomination.Outside the hotel, several dozen people protested. “Justice Gorsuch’s appearance at an establishment that benefits his president is something I’m concerned about,” said one of them, Maya Berry.Since joining the court in April, Justice Gorsuch has voted consistently with its most conservative members, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. On Tuesday, for instance, the three justices dissented from the court’s decision to stay the execution of Keith Tharpe, a Georgia death row inmate who said his trial was tainted by the participation of a racist juror.Appearances by justices before groups with political leanings are not unusual. Justices Thomas and Alito have addressed the Federalist Society. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, all members of the court’s liberal wing, have spoken before the American Constitution Society, a liberal group.Justice Gorsuch’s critics have focused on the venue of his talk rather than the nature of his audience. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said, for instance, that the appearance vindicated Democratic opposition to Justice Gorsuch’s nomination.“Justice Gorsuch speaking to a conservative group in the Trump Hotel, where the president continues to hold a financial stake, is everything that was wrong with his nomination,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “There’s a reason we questioned his independence during his confirmation hearings.”The lawsuits against Mr. Trump are based on the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which prohibits at least some federal officials from taking some kinds of gifts and payments from entities controlled by foreign governments. The Justice Department has argued that the emoluments clause does not bar ordinary commercial payments to Mr. Trump’s companies, and Mr. Trump’s defenders say he has taken measures to distance himself from his holdings.At his confirmation hearings in March, Justice Gorsuch briefly discussed the emoluments clause in an exchange with Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.“Among other things,” he said, “it prohibits members of the government of this country from taking emoluments gifts from foreign agents, and the question is, what exactly does that mean? And that is the subject on which there is ongoing litigation right now.”“I have to be very careful about expressing any views,” he said. Justice Gorsuch did not discuss the clause on Thursday."
"By any measure, Tahseen Chowdhury is no ordinary 17-year-old. He is president of the student government at Stuyvesant High School, among New York City’s most selective public schools, and leads the student advisory council for the borough of Manhattan. He even helped found two companies: an event photography business and a firm that teaches students computer programming and engineering.It stands to reason that Mr. Chowdhury, a senior, would cast the widest possible net when applying to college. But he is confining his search to New York — and not because he needs to stay close to family in East Elmhurst, Queens.Rather, Mr. Chowdhury, a Democrat, is mounting a campaign for the State Senate, and wants to be within striking distance of the State Capitol in Albany.With the State Legislature in session from January to June, Mr. Chowdhury envisions an unusual schedule of alternating semesters, one that would spread his college career over eight years. “If I win, I would take the spring semesters off to be in Albany and then go to college in the fall,” he said. “I will have to choose a college that will work with that schedule.”Mr. Chowdhury’s campaign is hardly unique. Across the New York region, and indeed the country, young people are turning their attention to politics, motivated in part by the election of President Trump. From mayoral races to state legislative campaigns, teenagers and others who are too young to vote are canvassing neighborhoods and learning the intricacies of electoral politics. Some are running for office themselves.The trend is heartening to academics and observers of public service like Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz. Dr. Benjamin said he has long detected a distinct lack of interest in elective office in young people, even those otherwise active in environmental advocacy and identity politics.Mr. Trump’s victory changed that, he said. “The reaction to Trump was: How did this happen and how do we keep it from happening again?” said Dr. Benjamin, himself a former county legislator in the Hudson Valley. “I keep telling people, ‘Run for office.’ There seems to be a new cohort of young people who are becoming engaged.”In Kansas, two 16-year-olds recently announced that they would seek the Democratic nomination for governor next year, and a 17-year-old announced this week that he would be running as a Republican. While some states have a minimum age for governors’ races, Kansas does not. Neither does Vermont, where 13-year-old Ethan Sonneborn drew national press coverage — much of it lighthearted — after he announced his intention to run for governor.In New York City, Mr. Chowdhury plans to challenge an incumbent state senator, Jose Peralta, in a Democratic primary in Queens next fall. In New York State, candidates must be 18 to hold state or local office, and Mr. Chowdhury will turn 18 just in time for the 2018 primary.Mr. Chowdhury comes from a working-class immigrant family in Queens (his father works in a deli and his mother delivers newspapers). He said he became disillusioned with Senator Peralta’s record after learning that he had joined the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of breakaway Democrats in the State Senate who collaborate with Republicans. The power-sharing arrangement allows Republicans to control the chamber despite being outnumbered by Democrats.“Partnering with Republicans has resulted in progressive bills not coming up for vote,” said Mr. Chowdhury, whose website lays out his position on issues like affordable housing, safe streets and single-payer health care. “I find that very deceptive.”The Independent Democratic Conference, which is led by Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, is taking the high road for now. When asked about Mr. Chowdhury’s challenge, Mr. Klein noted that he himself was elected as a state committeeman and district leader while still in his early 20s. “The political process should encourage young people to be involved,” he said.Some youthful candidacies have fizzled amid the realization that others may, in fact, be more qualified. Chetan Hebbur, who graduated from New York University this spring, pulled his hat from the ring only a few months after he announced his campaign for City Council in March. Instead, he threw his support behind another candidate, Jorge Vasquez, a fellow Democrat in his 30s from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.Mr. Hebbur was impressed by Mr. Vasquez’s experience as a civil rights lawyer and community advocate. And his one-time rival’s platform so closely mirrored his own that he “started feeling bad about running against the guy,” he said.As a result, Mr. Hebbur joined Mr. Vasquez’s staff as his director of communications. (Alas, Mr. Vasquez lost the primary in mid-September to Carlina Rivera.)Still, Mr. Hebbur believes that young people should capitalize on their age in seeking higher office, rising above any snickers or dismissals. “I was 21 and there was a novelty to me running,” he said, noting an article in The New York Post about his brief candidacy. “If novelty makes people listen, then maybe novelty is O.K. as long as the message is good.”Douglas Muzzio, a professor in the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College, said that Mr. Hebbur’s experience constituted an important engagement with civic life. “Running for office is like the tip of the political-participation iceberg,” he said. “There’s a whole mass of things that interested, informed young people can get involved in.”Other fresh-faced campaigns have run up against other obstacles. In the Westchester County village of Ardsley, N.Y., a high school junior, David Oks, thought he would appear on the ballot in November as an independent candidate for mayor. But last week, he was informed that someone had challenged the validity of his petition signatures; a review put him below the required number of 75.Mr. Oks is only 16, and according to state law, should have been ineligible to run. But because the county’s Board of Elections did not rule on his age, his candidacy remained valid until his petition signatures were successfully challenged.A student at the private Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, Mr. Oks is now planning that longest of political long shots: a write-in campaign. “For a lot of people, Nov. 8 was a pretty pivotal day,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s victory. “For me and for tens of millions of others, there was a necessity to get involved.”In Queens, Mr. Chowdhury is hoping that his inexperience will boost his chances next fall. “I’m so young,” he said, “that it’s impossible for me to have any special interests.”"
"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security will soon begin collecting social media data from all immigrants entering the United States, part of what agency officials call an effort to more effectively screen those coming to the country but privacy advocates see as an unnecessary intrusion that would do little to protect national security.The department will begin collecting the information on Oct. 18, the same day the Trump administration’s new travel ban on citizens of seven countries and restrictions on those from two others are set to take effect.Green card holders and naturalized citizens will also have their social media information collected, with the data becoming part of their immigration file. It was unclear whether the monitoring would take place only in the application process or could continue afterward.The department published the new requirement in the Federal Register last week, saying it would collect “social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results,” which would be included in an applicant’s immigration file. It said the data would come from “publicly available information obtained from the internet, public records, public institutions, interviewees, commercial data providers.”The data collection has alarmed privacy groups and lawyers, who expressed concerns on about how the department would use the information. Advocates say they also worry that the monitoring could suck in information on American citizens who communicate over social media with immigrants.“This would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the free speech that’s expressed every day on social media,” Faiz Shakir, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “This collect-it-all approach is ineffective to protect national security and is one more example of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda.”Efforts to collect social media information are not unique to the Trump administration. During the Obama administration, the department had begun asking visitors to voluntarily provide social media information, and had four pilot screening programs.After the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., counterterrorism officials and lawmakers grew increasingly worried about the use of social media by terrorist groups like the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Many members of Congress, mainly Republicans, began urging the Department of Homeland Security to use data gleaned from visa applicants’ or asylum seekers’ social media accounts as part of the immigration process.Congressional Democrats also supported the effort to collect social media data on visa applicants.“We believe these checks, focused on possible connections to terrorist activity, should be incorporated into D.H.S.’s vetting process for visa determinations, and that this policy should be implemented as soon as possible,” Democratic lawmakers said in a letter at the time.The attackers in San Bernardino, Tashfeen Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, had exchanged private online messages discussing their commitment to jihad and martyrdom, law enforcement officials said. But they did not post any public messages about their plans on Facebook or other social media platforms.One of the pilot projects, which began in December 2015, screened the social media accounts of applicants for so-called fiancé visas, the program under which Ms. Malik entered the United States.United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the part of the Department of Homeland Security that approves citizenship and green cards, has previously used social media as part of the screening process for Syrian refugees, but only when the person was flagged because of a hit in an intelligence database or when questions were raised during an interview with immigration officials.Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University, said although it was true that the Obama administration collected social media information, the new monitoring put in place by the Trump administration represented an escalation.“What is different here is that it appears that they are monitoring people who are already in the United States — green card holders, for example,” she said. “And there is a lack of transparency of how they are using this data, which does heighten the concerns for this group of people.”"
"WASHINGTON — Republicans’ release of a sweeping plan to rewrite the tax code has set off a scramble among Washington lobbyists and trade groups to protect valuable tax breaks and other long-ingrained provisions.The plan’s scant details make it hard to know what, exactly, is on the chopping block. But within hours of the plan’s unveiling on Wednesday, flash points emerged over measures that supporters said could hurt the housing market, raise borrowing costs and increase the tax burden on families in high-tax states.The response put Trump administration officials on the defensive as they embark on a campaign to sell the plan.“The lobbyists shouldn’t have input, but the people in Congress should have input, and we’ll be working with them closely as we turn this into a bill and get it to the president to sign this year,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Fox Business Network on Thursday.Opposition from the real estate industry was swift and vocal, with trade groups strongly criticizing elements of the plan that they say will make home-buying less attractive and weaken the housing market. While the plan specifically calls for preserving the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents are warning that a proposal to double the standard deduction will make taxpayers less likely to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage deduction.The deduction is a key incentive for people to buy homes, since it reduces their taxable income by the amount of interest paid on a mortgage. Real estate agents worry that doubling the standard deduction may provide a richer tax break than itemizing and claiming the mortgage deduction.“We have always said that tax reform — a worthy endeavor — should first do no harm to homeowners,” said William E. Brown, president of the National Association of Realtors.A proposal to limit the deductibility of corporate interest has prompted jockeying among powerful groups that rely on debt to help finance their operations, including real estate companies, private equity firms, financial companies and other businesses.The Build Coalition, a group of associations from the telecommunications, manufacturing and agriculture industries that formed to protect the corporate interest provision, warned that Republicans would be acting counter to their promise to spur business investment by following through on the proposal. Businesses that rely heavily on debt to finance their investments will see costs go up, they say, driving down profitability, investment and job creation.“Altering that would make it more difficult for American companies to compete in the global economy and harm job creation and long-term economic growth,” said Mac O’Brien, a spokesman for the group. “Fortunately, the discussion on tax reform is far from over.”Similar concerns are emanating from Wall Street, with the American Bankers Association warning that a limitation on borrowers’ ability to deduct interest expenses could “adversely impact economic growth.”Republicans have only slightly tipped their hand as to the overall structure of the tax rewrite. The plan would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and create a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses such as partnerships, sole proprietorships and family farms.It would also lower the top individual tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, while raising the bottom rate to 12 percent from 10 percent as it also doubles the standard deduction. The plan would eliminate many corporate “loopholes” and deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction. But it would also get rid of many provisions that are currently costly to the rich, like the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.The most politically fraught proposal is eliminating the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers who itemize to write off their property, state and local taxes. The measure is particularly prized in blue states with high property taxes, but is also widely used in some Republican districts in Virginia, New Jersey and California.Eliminating the deduction, which the real estate industry also opposes, would save more than $1 trillion over a decade and make room for the tax cuts. But Republican members of Congress in affected states have already expressed concern about the provision, and a plan that repeals the deduction could be impossible to pass.“The state and local tax piece is very concerning, because we’re already a donor state to Washington, and this would exacerbate that problem,” said Representative John J. Faso, Republican of New York, referring to the amount the state pays in taxes. “And so I want to see — based on income categories — how a hypothetical family of four with a certain amount of income, with a $8,000 property tax and state income tax bill, how they are affected.”Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, also expressed doubt on Thursday that the deduction would die easily.“That’s been a long-heralded and expected set of tax rules, and it’s really, really tough to change that,” Mr. Hatch said.Changes to core components of the tax plan could force Republicans to slim down the size of the tax cuts.“Republicans from high-taxed states are, in our view, unlikely to go along with the elimination of the SALT deduction,” said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking company Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, referring to the state and local tax deduction. “Keeping the SALT deduction, or even merely reducing it, would ultimately result in smaller tax cuts or a larger budget deficit, which we think would be a tough sell to congressional budget hawks.”Preliminary estimates of the tax plan found that it could cost as much as $2.2 trillion over 10 years. Progressive groups are already warning that the cuts will disproportionately benefit the rich, and that changes to the standard deduction could end up raising, not lowering, taxes on middle-class families.“Our No. 1 concern is that this delivers massive, massive tax cuts to millionaires and corporations,” said Michael Linden, an adviser to the progressive Not One Penny campaign, which is fighting to make sure the tax overhaul is not a boon for the rich.The group, which includes liberal organizations such as MoveOn, Tax March and the Working Families Party, has already spent more than $1 million advertising in congressional districts across the country to urge lawmakers from both parties to oppose tax cuts for the rich, and it expects to become more active.“We’ll be ramping it up,” Mr. Linden added. “This campaign has been bubbling below the surface for the last several months, but now it’s going to take center stage.”For its part, the Trump administration is maintaining that surging economic growth produced by the tax cuts will prevent the plan from adding to the deficit, and that it will benefit middle-class families.However, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser acknowledged in an interview with ABC News that it was too soon to make promises. It remains possible that some middle-class families could see their tax bills increase under the plan.“There’s an exception to every rule,” said Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council. “I can’t guarantee anything. You can always find a unique family somewhere.”"
"WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Black Caucus pressured Facebook this week to seriously examine how the site allowed Russian operatives to use advertising to target Black Lives Matter and sow racial divisions ahead of last year’s election.In a letter Tuesday to the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, Representative Robin Kelly, Democrat of Illinois, wrote that Russian-backed Facebook pages promoted “incendiary anti-immigrant rallies, targeted the Black Lives Matter movement and focused attentions on critical election swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan.”Russian groups backed by the country’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, paid Facebook to influence voters last year by “purchasing ads designed to inflame and exploit racial, political and economic rifts in the U.S.,” Ms. Kelly wrote.Ms. Kelly’s letter follows weeks of criticism of Facebook over its disclosure that Russians used fake pages and advertisements, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign. The company had long denied that Russians had exploited its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6.Now, Ms. Kelly said, she wants insight into how Facebook examines prospective advertisers, how it vets ads placed by foreign authorities and the “true cost and scope of Russia advertisements placed during the 2016 election cycle.”“It is my belief that Facebook cannot be the Trojan horse through which America’s vulnerabilities are exploited,” Ms. Kelly wrote in the letter. “With the information we now have in tow, you have a moral responsibility to rigorously assess your advertising policies and implement reforms that ensure that malicious actors — both foreign and domestic — do not pervert your site to promote a divisive and destabilizing agenda.”A spokesman for Facebook confirmed that the company received Ms. Kelly’s letter and that it was in communication with her office.Ms. Kelly, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee’s subcommittee on information technology, and several of her colleagues contacted Facebook seven days after President Trump’s win in November to express deep concerns about Facebook allowing advertisers to exclude and target ethnic groups.Tuesday’s letter ratchets up their concerns as several social networking sites face scrutiny from Congress and as other Congressional Black Caucus members such as Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, say they worry about Facebook’s role in the election and in allowing users to discriminate online.Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, noted that for many African-Americans, the incident raised memories of past government-orchestrated espionage and intimidation efforts, such as the F.B.I.’s surveillance of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.“Historically, those in the struggle for civil rights have not only been forced to confront institutions of racism in our society, they have also been forced to confront attacks and espionage activity from individual actors and organizations in and outside of government,” he said. “It is my hope that our tech community takes this matter seriously, is forthright with the special counsel and Congress, and does everything it can to make sure it is not manipulated like this again.”Last week, Facebook said it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked advertisements to Congress. Many of those ads, like those on the National Football League protest issue, targeted divisions in American society, sending conflicting messages to different users segmented by political and racial characteristics.Mr. Zuckerberg addressed his network of more than 2 billion people about the social network’s role in democracies this week and expressed regret for initially dismissing his company’s potential impact on the 2016 election.“We will continue to work to build a community for all people,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “We will do our part to defend against nation states attempting to spread misinformation and subvert elections. We’ll keep working to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, and to ensure our community is a platform for all ideas and force for good in democracy.”Twitter, another social network targeted by Russian operatives, planned to brief staff members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.The New York Times reported this month on evidence of Russian operators creating hundreds or thousands of fake Twitter accounts to flood the network with anti-Clinton messages during the campaign. The cybersecurity company FireEye identified what it called “warlists” of accounts linked to Russian intelligence that sometimes spewed messages like #WarAgainstDemocrats several times a minute.The House Intelligence Committee also announced on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the matter of Russian influence next month, and a Senate aide said Facebook, Twitter and Google officials have been invited to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1."
"A lower tax rate for corporations. Reduced taxes for partnerships like law firms. An easy way to bring overseas profits back to the United States without being taxed.Corporate America had a long wish list when it came to tax reform, and on Wednesday, President Trump gave companies just about everything they wanted.“This is much more than I think anyone could have hoped for,” said Robert Willens, an independent corporate tax expert. “I’ve never seen something like this. Taken together, this is the most dramatic and beneficial group of corporate tax reform suggestions we’ve ever had.”The list of those who stand to benefit from the proposed tax plan, which Mr. Trump promoted on Wednesday during a speech in Indianapolis, is long. Individual earners, small businesses, law firms, hedge funds, manufacturers and multinational corporations could all see dramatic tax cuts.There is no certainty that the main points in the White House plan will become law. Congress must now turn the nine-page proposal into a passable piece of legislation. But business leaders were nonetheless quick to applaud the broad outlines of the proposal, claiming that tax cuts they would spur new investment and grow the economy.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, called the plan “an encouraging step forward in our shared goal of a tax system that delivers higher economic growth, job creation and wages that our country desperately needs.”John Stephens, the AT&T chief financial officer, said it was “a big step toward meaningful reform that would encourage more investment and job creation in the United States.”And U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s chief executive, Thomas J. Donohue, said the proposed tax cuts were “good news for American families and employers.”Yet even as business leaders salivate at the prospect of lower taxes, skeptics are questioning whether companies would actually invest tax savings in things like factories and jobs, and whether such cuts would meaningfully help the economy, which is already expanding.“This is a very cynical document,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, a tax expert at the University of Southern California law school. “The extraordinary thing about the proposal is that we know that it loses trillions of dollars in revenue, yet at the same time the only people we can identify as guaranteed winners are the most affluent.”While the tax plan includes numerous changes to the ways individuals are taxed, some of the most far-reaching reforms would be for the companies that have long complained of an overly burdensome tax code.One of the most sweeping proposals would be to lower to 25 percent the tax rate for so-called pass-through businesses, which are currently taxed at the individual rates of their owners. Such a change would dramatically lower the taxes paid by the majority of American businesses. Some 95 percent of companies in the United States are structured as pass-through entities, generating the bulk of the government’s tax revenues.“A lower rate for pass-through entities is essential to ensuring small businesses are not left behind,” said Jay Timmons, the chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers.Another major development, especially for big companies that have long complained about their tax rate, would be the proposed lowering of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, well below the current rate of 35 percent.“A significantly lower corporate tax rate will help U.S. companies compete with companies from other industrialized countries and spur long-term economic growth,” said Mr. Stephens. “For AT&T, we would step up our investments in the technology and next-generation networks that are engines of our modern economy.’’The White House said that a corporate tax rate of 20 percent would increase American competitiveness, bringing the rate below 22.5 percent, which is what it claimed was the average corporate tax rate in the industrialized world.But tax experts questioned the White House’s accounting. “To use the 22.5 percent is simply intellectually dishonest,” said Mr. Kleinbard of U.S.C. “We’re including countries like Macau and Moldova in that number.”When countries’ tax rates are weighted by gross domestic product, the actual average is closer to 29.4 percent, according to the Tax Foundation.Regardless of the benchmark, the White House is pushing a dramatic cut to the corporate tax rate. “It’s going to increase corporate profits dramatically,” said Mr. Willens, the tax expert who has advised companies for 40 years. “It’s unbelievable to contemplate after all these years of doing this.”Perhaps the most dramatic suggestion in the tax plan is for a territorial tax system, which could allow multinational corporations to mostly avoid paying the United States government taxes on their overseas profits.Right now companies must pay steep taxes if they want to repatriate earnings made abroad, leading big corporations like Apple to keep billions of dollars overseas. And while details of the proposal were scarce, and may yet include some tax on foreign profits and a one-time repatriation tax on existing overseas profits, the broad outlines of the plan were good news for big business.“Moving to a territorial system is unbelievable,” said Mr. Willens. “It’s incredible to think that they are going to be able to repatriate foreign earnings without any tax at all.”Opponents point to studies showing that repatriation does not necessarily lead to greater investment or job creation by businesses.The Trump administration made no mention on Wednesday of how it planned to pay for such steep tax cuts, which could cost $2.2 trillion, according to the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit group. And from the moment it was announced, critics of the plan called it a giveaway to the rich.Business leaders, too, seemed to appreciate the fact that enacting a giant tax overhaul was no sure thing, especially after several failed attempts to overhaul the health care law.“It’s crunchtime for Congress,” said Mark A. Weinberger, chief executive of the financial services firm EY and chairman of the Business Roundtable’s Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee. Claiming that the president’s tax plan would “create jobs and growth” with lower tax rates, Mr. Weinberger said, “Congress needs to preserve these elements and fill in the details quickly so the proposals can become law by year’s end.”And even if the broad outlines of the proposed tax overhaul do get passed, amounting to a windfall for businesses large and small, there is one way the plan could adversely impact the economy.“This isn’t good for tax professionals,” Mr. Willens said. “There are people who have spent their whole careers trying to figure out how to repatriate overseas profits and lower corporate taxes. If this goes through, there won’t be much for them to do.”"
"WASHINGTON — Walking gingerly and on two canes, Representative Steve Scalise, the Republican whip, made an emotional return to the Capitol on Thursday, more than three months after a gunman nearly took his life during practice for a charity baseball game.“It shows you if you fight and persevere, you can overcome anything,” Mr. Scalise told reporters as he entered the House chamber to thundering applause from his colleagues, who were awaiting his return. He then delivered his first remarks on the House floor since the shooting on June 14.Mr. Scalise, his voice strong, said he wanted to “thank true angels across the way” — the Capitol Police officers who were wounded and fired the shots that are credited with preventing the gunman from harming anyone else; a fellow lawmaker who rushed to his aid and applied a tourniquet to his wound; and his doctors, who were seated in the House gallery.“You are my hero — you saved my life,” he told one of the officers, David Bailey, who was also in the gallery. The other officer, Crystal Griner, was not present.A man of deep Christian faith, Mr. Scalise repeatedly thanked God for his recovery, and he spoke of how he prayed during the chaotic, terrifying moments after the gunman had wounded him.“When I was laying on the ground one of the things I prayed for was that David and Crystal would be successful in carrying out their duties,” Mr. Scalise said, adding, “When I was laying there not long after the first shots were fired, I could hear a different-caliber weapon. And that told me that they had immediately engaged the shooter.”The gunman died after a shootout with the police.Mr. Scalise, 51, was grievously injured, and said he had undergone “many, many surgeries” and was learning to walk again. His office said he had spent the months since the shooting in an inpatient rehabilitation center, but that starting on Thursday, he would be back at work and undergoing outpatient therapy.“I’m definitely a living example that miracles really do happen,” he told his colleagues.The 15-minute speech, in a chamber packed with Republicans and Democrats who repeatedly gave him standing ovations, marked the first time Mr. Scalise has spoken of his ordeal; he has also granted an exclusive interview to the CBS news show “60 Minutes,’’ which will air on Sunday night. A crew from the network followed him in the Capitol on Thursday.The shooting took place at a baseball field in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Va., on June 14. Mr. Scalise said he had arrived at about 6:30 a.m. to practice with other Republican lawmakers for Congress’s annual charity baseball game. (Democrats were having their own practice at another field, he said.) The gunman, later identified as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., a suburb of St. Louis, opened fire shortly after 7 a.m.Standing at second base, Mr. Scalise was shot once in the left hip, according to the accounts of witnesses at the time, and collapsed as the shots rang out, one after another, from behind a chain-link fence near the third-base dugout. Witnesses said Mr. Scalise, of Louisiana, “army-crawled” from the infield to the grass as the shooting continued.By Mr. Scalise’s account, his fellow Republican, Representative Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, a former Army combat surgeon, rushed to his side and applied a tourniquet.“Who would have thought that God would have put Brad out there on that field with me, because the tourniquet he applied, many will tell you, saved my life so that I could actually make it to the hospital in time with all the blood loss,” Mr. Scalise said.In the aftermath of the shooting, Mr. Scalise said he had been struck by the “outpouring of love and warmth and prayers” — not only from colleagues and constituents, but also from world leaders, among them Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and King Abdullah II of Jordan.The congressman wound up his remarks with a call to bipartisanship — or at least politeness.“We are the people’s House, this is the place where those ideas are debated,” he said. “It is so important when we have those political battles we don’t make them personal.”"
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will seek to reconsider an Obama-era blueprint for protecting the greater sage grouse, a move that could lead to new mineral leasing, grazing and other commercial activities across the quirky bird’s Western habitat.The Interior Department intends this week to publish a formal notice of intent to amend 98 sage grouse habitat management plans across 10 states, according to multiple agency and state officials who have been briefed on the effort. Those plans, completed in 2015, were adopted after a decade of negotiations among conservationists, sportsmen and extraction industries as well as federal, state, local and tribal authorities.The elaborate compromise was designed to keep the sage grouse off the endangered species list, which would have required much greater restrictions on activities within the bird’s broad range.The sage grouse, which looks like a chesty chicken but struts like a spiky-tailed peacock, is renowned for its elaborate mating dance.The agency’s decision is not entirely unexpected. Earlier this year, Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, ordered a review of the sage grouse plans, in part to determine whether they were hindering energy production. A task force recommended changes that could loosen protections for the bird.Environmental activists say reopening the plans, as opposed to making adjustments administratively, threatens to dismantle protections altogether. But oil and gas industry leaders hailed the move as overdue.“I’m happy to see that it looks like it’s coming out,” Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, said of the Interior Department notice. She called the state plans developed under the Obama administration a “deeply flawed” one-size-fits-all approach that exaggerated the threats posed by natural resource extraction.“This Interior Department is much more willing to cooperate with states, and I think that is very positive for ensuring the sage grouse is protected without killing jobs and economic opportunities,” she said.The seven-page draft notice says that the Bureau of Land Management intends to consider amending “all or some B.L.M. land use plans that were amended or revised in 2014 or 2015 regarding greater sage grouse conservation in the states of California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Montana.” The notice, it says, will begin a 45-day comment process during which anyone can propose changes to the plans.Several Western state officials, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak for their governors, said Interior Department officials indicated they would seek amendments to the sage grouse plans in a conference call on Monday. The call included Kathleen Benedetto, a special assistant to Mr. Zinke who was a leader of the sage grouse review team.Precisely what changes the Interior Department may seek are yet unknown, but the regulatory process could take years. People on the call said Interior Department officials suggested they needed to start the process now in order to complete it within President Trump’s first term.Still, the prospect of changes alarmed environmental activists.“This is a big deal because these plans were the result of an unprecedented effort among dozens of groups,” said Randi Spivak, public lands program director for the Center for Biological Diversity. She accused Mr. Zinke of planning changes that favored mining and petroleum companies and that would hurt the bird’s chances of survival.“Zinke might as well have formed a shotgun posse to kill off the sage grouse directly,” she said.Brian Rutledge, director of the Audubon Society’s sagebrush ecosystem initiative, said that the sage grouse plan was developed over many years and based on extensive input.“A move to amend the plans would be pulling the rug out from under literally hundreds of Western stakeholders from all parts of the political spectrum who came together to protect an entire ecosystem,” Mr. Rutledge said.Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, declined to comment on the agency’s effort. She cited a news release about Mr. Zinke’s decision in June to launch a sage grouse review team.The changes could be challenged in court and could prompt some groups to petition the Fish and Wildlife Service to add the grouse and some 350 other species in the sagebrush steppe ecosystem to the endangered species list."
"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a case that could deal a crushing blow to organized labor.It was one of 11 cases the justices added to the court’s docket from the roughly 2,000 petitions seeking review that had piled up during the court’s summer break.In the labor case, the court will consider whether public-sector unions may require workers who are not members to help pay for collective bargaining. If the court’s answer is no, unions would probably lose a substantial source of revenue.The question was before the justices last year in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, and they seemed poised to rule against the unions when the case was argued in January 2016. But the death of Justice Antonin Scalia the next month resulted in a 4-to-4 deadlock.That may have given the unions only a brief reprieve. Justice Scalia’s replacement, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, has voted consistently with the court’s more conservative members and is likely to supply a fifth vote against the unions.A ruling allowing workers to refuse to pay the fees would be the culmination of a decades-long campaign by conservative groups aimed at weakening unions that represent public employees.The new case concerns Mark Janus, who works for the state government in Illinois and is represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. He sued the union, saying he does not agree with its positions and should not be forced to pay fees to support its work.An Illinois law requires government workers who choose not to join a union to “pay their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.” The Supreme Court has said that such laws are constitutional.In a 1977 decision, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, the court made a distinction between two kinds of compelled payments. It said workers need not pay for the political activities of unions, like campaign spending, as that would violate their First Amendment rights.But it is constitutional, the court added, to require nonmembers to help pay for the union’s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and to ensure “labor peace.”The challengers in the new case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, No. 16-1466, asked the court to overrule the Abood decision. All compulsory fees, they argued, violate the First Amendment because the subjects of labor negotiations between unions and the government are all matters of public concern.Unions reject the First Amendment arguments, saying that collective bargaining is different from political activity. They said the plaintiffs were seeking to reap the benefits of such bargaining without paying their fair share of the cost.Union leaders reacted to the court’s decision to hear the case with dismay bordering on alarm. “This case is yet another example of corporate interests using their power and influence to launch a political attack on working people and rig the rules of the economy in their own favor,” Lee Saunders, the president of the union in the case, said in a statement.Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which represents Mr. Janus, said he was pleased the court had agreed to step in.”We are now one step closer,” he said in a statement, “to freeing over five million public sector teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other employees from the injustice of being forced to subsidize a union as a condition of working for their own government.”The Supreme Court also agreed to hear a pair of cases about searches of vehicles in unusual circumstances. In one, Collins v. Virginia, No. 16-1027, the police entered the driveway of a suspect’s house without permission, inspected a parked motorcycle covered by a tarp and learned that it was stolen.Based on that evidence, they arrested Ryan Collins, who was later convicted of receiving stolen property. The Virginia Supreme Court said the search, which took place on private property and ordinarily would have required a warrant, was proper under “the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement.”The exception is based on the “ready mobility” of vehicles. The state Supreme Court ruled that the exception applies even when a vehicle is stationary and on private property. “Regardless of whether it was ‘immediately mobile’ at the precise moment of the search,” the court said, “the motorcycle and its rider nonetheless posed a significant flight risk.”In dissent, Justice William C. Mims said the exception applies to a search “of a vehicle, not for a vehicle.”In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, lawyers for Mr. Collins said the state court had stretched the automobile exception beyond recognition. “A search of a vehicle pulled over on the side of a public highway is constitutionally different from a search of a vehicle parked alongside a house,” they wrote.Lawyers for the state responded that the search was proper because “despite being under a tarp, the motorcycle was readily mobile, parked in a driveway with easy access to the street.”The second case involving a vehicle search the justices agreed to hear concerned Terrence Byrd, who was driving a rental car with the renter’s permission but was not listed as an authorized driver on the rental agreement when he was stopped for a traffic violation in Pennsylvania. A search of the car uncovered drugs.In rejecting Mr. Byrd’s appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, acknowledged that federal appeals courts have differed about “whether the sole occupant of a rental vehicle has a Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy when that occupant is not named in the rental agreement.” The Third Circuit’s own precedents, the court said, “determined such a person has no expectation of privacy and therefore no standing to challenge a search of the vehicle.”The Supreme Court is now poised to resolve that dispute in the case, Byrd v. United States, No. 16-1371."
"WASHINGTON — President Trump failed again this week to fulfill his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health plan. Now he is taking aim at Mr. Obama’s central environmental legacy, the Clean Power Plan.The administration has made clear its desire to repeal the Obama energy plan. But what would take its place remains a mystery.The Environmental Protection Agency is expected in the coming days to reveal its strategy for reversing the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants across the country. Yet while Mr. Trump has declared the Obama-era plan dead — “Did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone,” he told a cheering crowd in Alabama recently — industry executives say they expect that utilities could still be subject to some restrictions on carbon emissions.“I would be surprised if repeal did not lead to replacement,” said Paul Bailey, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.If the E.P.A. does open the door to a new, weaker set of rules that utilities and others favor, it will most likely touch off a legal battle with environmental groups and pose a bureaucratic challenge to an agency where critical senior positions remain vacant. It could also force the agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has rejected the scientific consensus that human emissions cause climate change, to implicitly acknowledge that greenhouse gases harm human health and that the E.P.A. has an obligation to regulate them.“There’s an internal debate over what the overall approach toward greenhouse gases should be, and it’s hard to formulate policy if you haven’t come to terms with the outcome of the debate,” said David M. Konisky, a professor of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University.The parallels between the Clean Power Plan and the Affordable Care Act go only so far. The health care law, which was passed by Congress, offered a tangible benefit to many Americans and was firmly in place when Mr. Trump entered office. The Clean Power Plan, a regulation, not legislation, has not taken effect and is tied up in a federal appeals court.But environmental activists and conservative opponents alike say both cases show that demanding a policy be repealed is easier than making it happen. Finding a replacement is even harder.“From the perspective of advocacy and political strategy, I think there’s a lot of similarities. Members of Congress campaigned for six or seven years to fully repeal Obamacare, and there were no conversations about replace, or nothing of substance,” said Christine Harbin, vice president of external affairs at Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group. Of the Clean Power Plan, she said, “It may be difficult to fully repeal.”The Clean Power Plan aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants 32 percent below 2005 levels and required each state to develop carbon-cutting plans. Enacting the regulation was considered vital to helping the United States reach its commitment to reduce emissions under the Paris agreement. Mr. Trump has said he intends to withdraw from that accord.The United States Chamber of Commerce, coal companies and most Republican lawmakers strongly opposed the regulation. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March to eliminate it, fulfilling a campaign promise to end what he denounced as a job-killing regulation.Over the past several months, though, some of the very people who advocated killing Mr. Obama’s climate policy have told Mr. Pruitt that his agency should devise a new, albeit weaker, rule to regulate carbon emissions in its place. Leading industry groups — including the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, and utility lobbies like the Edison Electric Institute — have pressed the administration for a replacement.“We didn’t always see eye-to-eye with the last administration on how to deal with climate in the regulatory space,” said Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, which joined 28 states to challenge the Clean Power Plan in federal court. “But we’re comfortable with having a policy, even a regulation, that addresses climate change. It’s about getting the regulation right.”In public, industry leaders say their companies already are on a greener trajectory. Behind the scenes, they also worry that simply killing the climate rule would not hold up in court, and would invite even tougher regulations under a future Democratic president. They are advocating a narrow regulation that allows utilities to reduce pollution at individual plants, like substituting fuel or improving the efficiency of furnaces.Dan Byers, the senior director for policy at the Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute, said it’s important that the E.P.A.’s repeal opens the door to such a replacement. Without one, he said, the agency would be vulnerable to lawsuits for not regulating carbon dioxide.“The uncertainty that would be associated with that is far more risky than having a rule in place which is reasonable, achievable and cost-effective,” he said.The E.P.A. declined to answer questions about the repeal process.“We don’t comment on rules undergoing interagency review,” Amy Graham, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement.If Mr. Pruitt moves to replace the Clean Power Plan, it could signal that he intends to abandon a larger fight to challenge the essential underpinning of federal climate policy.The so-called endangerment finding, adopted after the Supreme Court found in 2007 that greenhouse gases are a pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, declares that such emissions may “reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” Mr. Pruitt has been under pressure from people who reject established climate science to challenge the determination, but a chorus of more pragmatic voices inside the administration and industry have insisted that doing so would be a legal morass with an uncertain outcome.Myron Ebell, a climate denier who led the E.P.A. transition team for the Trump administration, said he still hoped to see Mr. Pruitt challenge the endangerment finding in the future. That could happen through a series of debates on climate science that Mr. Pruitt has described as a “red team, blue team” exercise.In the meantime, Mr. Ebell said he was confident the Clean Power Plan would crumble and said the failure of Republicans to upend the Affordable Health Care was a lesson for Democrats: Pass legislation.“If you want to make something durable, you better get a law passed by Congress,” he said. “What one president can do by pen and by phone another president can undo by pen and by phone.”"
"WASHINGTON — In 2001, when surging budget surpluses fueled hopes of extinguishing the national debt, a pitched battle broke out over President George W. Bush’s proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut. Never mind that the tax cut’s 10-year tab was supposed to leave behind more than $3 trillion in surpluses — Democrats and some Republicans said that the tax cut was just too large.Fast forward to President Trump’s Washington, where the budget deficit for this fiscal year is projected to near $700 billion and the federal debt has topped $20 trillion.A new tax cut is emerging to rival those of the Bush years, and the deficit hawks have hardly peeped.“It’s a great talking point when you have an administration that’s Democrat-led,” said Representative Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of about 150 conservative House members. “It’s a little different now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.”For years, Republican lawmakers lamented the soaring national debt, pressing for spending cuts and clinging to the mantle of fiscal responsibility. But last week, Senate Republicans hammered out a deal to allow for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, betting that supercharged growth will make up for lost revenue, a potentially dubious prospect. The tax plan outlined Wednesday by the White House and Republican leaders in the House and Senate could cost more than $2 trillion over the next decade, according to a preliminary estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan advocacy group.This month, the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate voted to raise the debt limit without doing anything to rein in spending.Republican lawmakers are pushing to increase military spending by tens of billions of dollars, topping even Mr. Trump’s request for a beefed-up military. Democrats are sharing in the fiscal intemperance, lining up behind a “Medicare for all” proposal despite having no definitive plan for how to pay for universal, government-provided health coverage.And as Congress mulls large tax cuts, the tabs for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria keep rising.When Mr. Bush took office and pushed for a big tax cut, the fiscal outlook was strong. The Congressional Budget Office in 2001 was projecting $5.6 trillion in budget surpluses over 10 years.Now, the budget office forecasts that deficits will total $10.1 trillion over the next decade. The deficit is expected to top $1 trillion a year in 2022 and keep growing from there. Federal debt held by the public is at the highest level since shortly after World War II, at 77 percent of the gross domestic product.“I think the greatest threat to our nation is us,” warned Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and a member of the Senate Budget Committee. “The way we handle our finances, we as a nation are the greatest threat to our nation. It’s not ISIS. It’s not North Korea. It’s not ascendant China. It’s not Russia. We are the greatest threat.”But such voices are strangely quiet these days in Washington. Even Mr. Corker seems accommodating.Last week, he reached a deal with another Republican on the budget panel, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, to allow a tax cut of up to $1.5 trillion over a decade, helping pave the way for the overhaul of the tax code that is a top goal for Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans. He did say he would not vote for a final tax plan if it would add to the deficit.The mantra now is economic growth.“Every Republican I know of is concerned about the deficit,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. “Every Republican I know of is concerned about tepid growth, too.”While Republicans denounced the ballooning debt when President Barack Obama was in office, they have much less of a political incentive to dwell on the issue now that their party controls the government.“There’s been less talk about it this year with a Republican-led administration than there has been the last seven or eight years,” said Mr. Walker, who bristled at the Senate’s plan for tax cuts that would add to the deficit. He said it was imperative that lawmakers pay attention to the debt.Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said it seems like “fiscal responsibility is more about playing defense than it really is caring about the issue.”“The party that is the minority, you hear them talk about fiscal responsibility so much more to try to stop the other party from implementing their agenda,” she said. “But then when that party gets in power, and you’re seeing that now, they’re more likely to throw those fiscal concerns to the wayside in order to implement their agenda without having to face any of the hard choices about how to pay for things.”Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, said his party deserves blame. He warned that the United States could wind up facing an economic collapse akin to that in Venezuela, adding that Republicans in the House and Senate had not demonstrated that they possess “the intellectual understanding of the dangers posed by these deficits and accumulated debt.”Mr. Trump, who has called himself “the king of debt,” may be setting the tone.During his presidential campaign, he insisted that he could eliminate the national debt in eight years, even as he promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, programs that are projected to consume an ever larger share of federal spending as the country’s population ages.After Mr. Trump struck a deal with Democrats on a short-term debt limit extension, Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona, asked, “In this entire discussion, how many members have you heard, how many from the White House said, ‘We’re in the middle of a demographic crisis that’s going to crush us in just a few years; let’s get to work on it’?”He left unsaid the answer to his question: Not many.The change in tone on fiscal matters has been swift. This spring, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, asserted that the tax overhaul needed to be revenue neutral, citing the nation’s debt and invoking Mr. Trump’s Democratic predecessor.“We added an enormous amount of debt during the Obama years,” Mr. McConnell said.Now, Republican lawmakers are betting that economic growth will fix the nation’s fiscal woes with no pain and a lot of gain.“The only way we’re going to solve our long-term debt and deficit issue to allow the federal government to have the revenue it’s going to need to fund all these promises made is with strong — and I mean strong — economic growth,” said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the Senate Budget Committee. “You’re not going to achieve that with an awful tax system.”Mr. Kennedy, another member of the budget panel, said Americans have to have faith.“If we do it right, then the economy will be stimulated appropriately and tax revenues will go up and the deficit won’t increase,” Mr. Kennedy said. “Now, I can’t prove to you that that will happen. But neither can anybody else.”"
"OTTAWA — While President Trump has reserved his harshest words on trade for Mexico and China, Canada, one of America’s closest allies, has emerged as a major pressure point on trade, with the countries’ leaders trading barbs over lumber, dairy products, airplanes, and even magazine paper.In the latest move, the Trump administration imposed a huge tariff on a new aircraft made by Montreal’s Bombardier to compensate for what it deemed unfair subsidies by Canadian governments.The focus on Canada reflects the complexities that Mr. Trump faces in remaking the global rules of trade.He has threatened punitive tariffs on imported goods and vowed to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. He has promised to level the playing field with China and Mexico.But aggressively targeting China could disrupt the global supply chain, raising costs for American manufacturers. It could also inflame geopolitical tensions at a time when Washington needs Beijing’s help in dealing with North Korea.Relations with Mexico are already beleaguered over clashes on immigration, while taking on trade often means taking on exports from plants owned by American corporations.The sheer volume of trade with Canada makes it an easy target for actions against individual companies or industries. And the economy’s relatively small size, along with its economic and military dependence on the United States, gives Canada little strength for punching back.The Bombardier case is just one in a long series of trade-related actions. Canada is rehashing the North American Free Trade Agreement, throwing the future of its businesses and workers into flux. The United States has imposed duties on softwood lumber, one of Canada’s most iconic exports, while weighing measures that would clamp down on Canadian exports of steel, aluminum and solar panels.“Canadians view this as poking Canada in the eye,” said Jerry Dias, the head of Unifor, the country’s large private sector union, which represents some Bombardier workers. “Canadians who view the U.S. as our natural ally are now wondering what’s going on.”The trade case against Bombardier, which was brought by the American aerospace giant Boeing, is typically a dry and routine affair. It centers on government subsidies and accusations of unfairly low sales prices.But now trade is politically charged.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has asked the American president to intervene to persuade Boeing to drop the case against Bombardier. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain joined the chorus of criticism against the United States, since the wings for the aircraft, the CSeries, are made in Northern Ireland. It also soured the mood for the latest round of Nafta negotiations, which finished on Wednesday in Ottawa.Speaking from the conclusion of the talks, Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign affairs minister and the lead minister on the Nafta talks, said the country would “fight very, very hard” when it came to Bombardier. Ms. Freeland said she had raised the issue with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative.“I do want to remind Canadians that aggressive actions and aggressive decisions by commerce are nothing new,” she added, a reference to the United States Commerce Department, which imposed the tariff on the Bombardier aircraft. “They are certainly familiar to us from the softwood lumber dispute.”After an official visit to China, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, told a group of reporters in Hong Kong on Wednesday that Boeing had initiated the case, not the Trump administration. But he nonetheless emphasized that it was emblematic of the president’s aggressive posture on trade.Mr. Ross said the administration had been “much more enforcement oriented” than its predecessors. “I wouldn’t be surprised if that trend continues,” he said.For Bombardier, the decision to impose tariffs of more than 200 percent on the CSeries aircraft creates huge uncertainty for a company that was betting on the product to improve its fortunes.The duties could be increased or ultimately eliminated in a series of rulings in the coming months. But they go into force immediately, tripling the jet’s price in the United States and most likely chilling future sales in the market it was meant to serve.Such trade actions could have a spillover effect. Bombardier estimates that work related to the new airliner will eventually create 22,000 jobs at American suppliers, in states like Kansas and West Virginia. The company employs 4,300 aerospace workers in Northern Ireland and 17,000 in Canada.“I don’t know why they are doing what they are doing in the United States, but I’m worried that it might hit us here,” said Nathalie Leclerc, a bartender in Montreal, Bombardier’s hometown. “Bombardier might cut jobs and production.”While international trade rules limit Canada’s ability to retaliate, Mr. Trudeau has been trying to use a military deal to influence Boeing. The prime minister has repeatedly suggested that Canada would not close a 6.4 billion Canadian dollar ($5.2 billion) deal to buy F-18 fighter jets from Boeing if it continued with its Bombardier complaint.There are currently no active trade cases in Canada involving American imports. But the United States administration is considering a range of actions that could ensnare Canadian exports.Along with cases against Canadian lumber and Bombardier, the United States has imposed tariffs for illegal subsidies on magazine paper. It is also weighing sweeping restrictions on Canadian exports of steel and aluminum, as well as solar products.The Bombardier ruling heightened tensions at the Nafta talks. Even before the decision, Canadian officials already appeared frustrated by American negotiators’ failure to put forward specific text on some of the president’s proposals.“Without a formal position tabled, we can’t respond to it,” Ms. Freeland said.Mr. Lighthizer said that the United States had discussed all of its goals with Canada and Mexico and was preparing in the next round to propose specific wording on more difficult topics, like requiring more goods to be made in the United States.Chad Bown, a trade analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the Trump administration may see conflicts like those over airplanes and softwood lumber as additional points to be traded away at the negotiating table.“The Trump administration may see this as a type of leverage in Nafta,” he said. “Now they have a potential bargaining chip that they didn’t have before to try to extract something from Canada.”But the disputes combined with Mr. Trump’s protectionist approach may be prompting questions in Canada about the value of trade deals.“Canada, in general, has gone from trade skeptical to trade embracing,” said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling organization. “Now things have swung back a little bit.The frustrations go back decades.When Canada entered a trade agreement with the United States in 1989 that was expanded later into Nafta, the lumber dispute was also active. The Conservative government at the time promised that the deal would free Canada from such trade cases. It ended up with a system known in Nafta as Chapter 19, which allows parties to appeal the type of duties that were imposed on Bombardier.As part of the current negotiations, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that measure. Given the Bombardier outcome, Canada’s opposition is likely to become more entrenched.“We have forest workers and forest-dependent communities saying why does this keep happening to us?’” John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, said of the softwood lumber spat, which is in its fifth round since 1982. Canada has ultimately been successful in all of them to date.At the restaurant in a Husky gas station in Williams Lake, British Columbia, a lumber town, there was resignation and irritation about going through the trade dispute all over again.“The softwood lumber deal? That’s a Trump thing,” said Charlie Grover, who drives a lumber truck. “We know that they won’t win in court. So eventually we’ll be back to no tariff.”"
"SAN FRANCISCO — After a weekend when Americans took to social media to debate President Trump’s admonishment of N.F.L. players who do not stand for the national anthem, a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the issue with hashtags such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee.As Twitter prepared to brief staff members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, researchers from a public policy group have been following hundreds of accounts to track the continuing Russian operations to influence social media discourse and foment division in the United States.For three weeks, a harsh spotlight has been trained on Facebook over its disclosure that Russians used fake pages and ads, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign.But there is evidence that Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian influence campaign last year. In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using “bot” accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers.Twitter has struggled for years to rein in the fake accounts overrunning its platform. Unlike Facebook, the service does not require its users to provide their real name (or at least a facsimile of one) and allows automated accounts — arguing that they are a useful tool for tasks such as customer service. Beyond those restrictions, there is also an online black market for services that can allow for the creation of large numbers of Twitter bots, which can be controlled by a single person while still being difficult to distinguish from real accounts.Since last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts — human users and suspected bots alike — they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem.Of 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent “had a primary theme of anti-Americanism,” the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa — short for anti-fascist — protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea’s use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump’s earlier wiretapping claims.In the face of such public scrutiny, Twitter has said almost nothing about what it knows about Russia’s use of its platform. But Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he would like to know exactly what the company has done to find covert Russian activity and what it has discovered so far about fake accounts — including their reach and impact.“I think right now the public is aware of only a subset of a subset of Russian activity online,” Mr. Schiff said in an interview. He said Facebook long denied that there had been Russian exploitation of its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6.Mr. Schiff said the tech companies have asked for assistance from American intelligence agencies in trying to find and stop illicit interference from other countries, a request he said he supports.The House Intelligence Committee announced on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the matter of Russian influence next month, and a Senate aide said Facebook, Twitter and Google have been invited to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.This month, The New York Times reported on evidence of Russian operators creating hundreds or thousands of fake Twitter accounts to flood the network with anti-Clinton messages during the campaign. The cybersecurity company FireEye identified what it called “warlists” of accounts linked to Russian intelligence that sometimes spewed messages like #WarAgainstDemocrats several times a minute.Both DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, which spread the leaked emails and documents and were identified as having been created by Russian intelligence, used accounts that Twitter has not suspended, though they have been dormant for months. In some cases, the Russian exploitation of Facebook and Twitter was linked: “Heart of Texas,” a Facebook page advocating the secession of Texas that was identified as one of 470 fake profiles and pages linked to Russia, also had a Twitter feed — now suspended — called @itstimetosecede.Experts on Russia inside and outside the government say President Vladimir V. Putin had multiple goals in last year’s campaign of hacking, leaking and stealth propaganda. He hoped to damage, if not defeat, Mrs. Clinton, whom he blamed for encouraging pro-democracy protests in Russia and neighboring states.But Mr. Putin also sought to darken the image of the United States, making it a less attractive model for other countries and reducing its international influence, said Mark R. Jacobson, a Georgetown professor and co-author of a new report on Russian influence operations.Last week, Facebook said it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to Congress. Many of those ads, like the opposing Twitter hashtags on the N.F.L. anthem issue, targeted divisions in American society by simultaneously sending conflicting messages to different users segmented by political and racial characteristics.“What we see over and over again is that a lot of the messaging isn’t about politics, a specific politician, or political parties,” said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. “It’s about creating societal division, identifying divisive issues and fanning the flames.”Her group’s web “dashboard” is called Hamilton 68. It is named for No. 68 of the Federalist Papers, believed to have been written by Alexander Hamilton, which warns of foreign meddling in American elections. The tool does not identify the activity of specific Twitter users but highlights the activity of the 600 accounts that researchers believe are either tied to the Russian government or repeat the themes of its propaganda.For its part, Twitter has not said much about what it plans to say in the Congressional briefing.“Twitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies, and will continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation that violate our Terms of Service,” Twitter said in a statement.Twitter has also said it was working to crack down on bots that distribute tweets en masse or that attempt to manipulate the platform’s trending topics.Colin Crowell, Twitter’s vice president of public policy, government and philanthropy, said in a blog post in June that the company should not be an arbiter of whether a tweet is truthful or not. Because Twitter is open and real-time, he said the platform is the best antidote to misinformation, when “journalists, experts and engaged citizens Tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds.”Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said the company’s defense has some merit.“Twitter functions more like a broadcast network,” she said. “People say things and everyone can hear it. When false information is stated, people can jump on false statements and challenge it.”"
"Eight years after the Great Recession officially ended, the fruits of economic growth are finally spreading to low-wage workers, racial and ethnic minorities and other groups that were largely left out of the early stages of the recovery.But in a pattern that has become familiar in recent decades, the biggest gains continued to flow to the richest Americans.The typical American family had a net worth of $97,300 in 2016, up 16 percent from 2013 after adjusting for inflation, according to data released by the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday. The gains were broad-based, cutting across racial, educational and economic categories — a significant shift from the years immediately after the recession, when both income and wealth continued to decline for many families.But despite the gains, wealth also become more concentrated:• The richest 1 percent of households controlled 38.6 percent of total wealth in 2016, up from 36.3 percent in 2013.• The bottom 90 percent of households controlled 22.8 percent of all wealth.Inequality could grow even starker under the tax plan unveiled Wednesday by President Trump and congressional Republicans. That plan would sharply reduce taxes on corporations and certain forms of business income, as well as eliminate the estate tax, which falls on only the wealthiest households. Mr. Trump has said his plan would not reduce taxes on the rich over all, but most independent experts are skeptical of that claim.Wednesday’s data, from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, shows the strength of the economic rebound in recent years, but also just how large a hole the recession left in many households’ finances.The survey is notable for providing information not just on Americans’ yearly income but also on their assets, debts and overall net worth — measures that are in many ways more important to families’ financial security. In terms of income, the typical American has made significant progress in recent years, with median household income nearly back to its prerecession peak.The broader measures of household finances provided by the survey paint a less rosy picture. The recession sliced nearly 40 percent off the typical household’s net worth, and even after the recent rebound, median net worth remains more than 30 percent below its 2007 level.For many groups, the recovery is even more incomplete.Younger, less-educated and lower-income workers have experienced relatively strong income gains in recent years, but remain far short of their prerecession level in both income and wealth. Only for the richest 10 percent of Americans does net worth surpass the 2007 level.Racial and ethnic minorities experienced the strongest gains in wealth in the 2016 survey, a stark reversal from three years earlier, when the survey showed minority families losing ground even as white families experienced modest gains.Black families’ net worth rose 29 percent between 2013 and 2016, and Hispanic families had a 46 percent gain; white families saw a more modest 17 percent increase.The racial wealth gap, however, remains large and continues to grow in absolute terms. The median white family had a net worth of $171,000 in 2016, nearly 10 times that of the median black family.In recent years there has been a striking disconnect between the confidence shown by investors — who have pushed the stock market to record after record — and the comparative pessimism displayed by many Americans. Wednesday’s data, however, makes clear that a small fraction of households enjoy an outsize share of the stock-market gains.Just over half of American families — 52 percent — owned stock in 2016, the first time stockholders represented a majority of Americans since before the financial crisis. But only a relative handful of families own stock outside of retirement accounts, and even counting those accounts, their holdings are often small.The typical stock owner held $40,000 in stock in 2016; among those in the top 10 percent of earners, that figure was nearly $365,000.Households have made significant progress in one area: debt.Americans are significantly less indebted than before the recession and, significantly, they are better able to afford the debts they have. The median borrower had debts equal to 95.1 percent of income in 2016; the figure was 111.1 percent before the recession and rose to 118.8 percent in the immediate aftermath. Moreover, fewer Americans report being late on debt payments, filing for bankruptcy or taking out high-interest payday loans.One type of debt is still rising, however: student loans. More than 22 percent of families reported having education debt in 2016, up from 15 percent before the recession. The median borrower owed $19,000.The oldest Americans have seen a significant rebound in their wealth in recent years; the typical household headed by someone 75 or older is now worth modestly more than before the recession, after adjusting for inflation. But younger retirees and those on the verge of retirement haven’t come close to making up what they lost in the recession.That’s not surprising: Older workers were especially exposed to the stock-market plunge and didn’t have much time to recover before retirement.The median household headed by someone between the ages of 55 and 74 had less than $60,000 in financial assets in 2016, down from roughly $80,000 in 2007. Adding to the challenge, older Americans’ homes — the principal nonfinancial asset for many families — are still worth less than before the recession.“This is not good news for retirement security,” said Monique Morrissey, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute."
"WASHINGTON — Urgent new orders went out earlier this month for United States Navy warships that have been plagued by deadly mishaps this year.More sleep and no more 100-hour workweeks for sailors. Ships steaming in crowded waters like those near Singapore and Tokyo will now broadcast their positions as do other vessels. And ships whose crews lack basic seamanship certification will probably stay in port until the problems are fixed.All seemingly obvious standards, military officials say, except that the Navy only now is rushing the remedies into effect after two collisions in two months left 17 sailors dead, despite repeated warnings about the looming problems from congressional watchdogs and the Navy’s own experts dating to 2010.“Many of the issues we’re discussing today have been known to Navy leaders for years. How do we explain that, Admiral?” Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, demanded of Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, at a hearing last week.“Senator, there is no explanation,” Admiral Richardson said.The orders issued recently by the Navy’s top officer for ships worldwide, Vice Adm. Thomas S. Rowden, drew on the lessons that commanders gleaned from a 24-hour fleetwide suspension of operations last month to examine basic seamanship, teamwork and other fundamental safety and operational standards.Collectively, current and former officers said, the new rules mark several significant cultural shifts for the Navy’s tradition-bound fleets. At least for the moment, safety and maintenance are on par with operational security, and commanders are requiring sailors to use old-fashioned compasses, pencils and paper to help track potential hazards, as well as reducing a captain’s discretion to define what rules the watch team follows if the captain is not on the ship’s bridge.“Rowden is stomping his foot and saying, ‘We’ve got to get back to basics,’” said Vice Adm. William Douglas Crowder, a retired commander of the Seventh Fleet and a former deputy chief of naval operations, who reviewed the four-page directive issued on Sept. 15, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. “We ought to be doing this anyhow.”Admiral Richardson is expected to announce additional guidance to the Navy in the next several days that builds off Admiral Rowden’s directive. “We took some time to stop, take a break and review our fundamentals, to ensure that we’re operating safely and effectively and to correct any areas that required immediate attention,” Admiral Richardson told the senators last week.The new orders come as the fallout continues from four Navy accidents in the western Pacific this year, including the two fatal crashes: the destroyer Fitzgerald colliding with a freighter near Tokyo in June, and a second destroyer, the John S. McCain, colliding with a tanker last month while approaching Singapore.The commander of the Navy’s Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift, said this week that he would retire after being notified that he was no longer in the running to take charge of the Pentagon’s overall Pacific Command, which would oversee any military operations against North Korea.Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the former head of the Seventh Fleet, based in Japan and the Navy’s largest overseas, was removed last month in connection with the accidents. And Admiral Rowden himself has also said he will retire early.It has been a sobering time for commanders not just in the Seventh Fleet, which has been closely scrutinized, but also the Navy’s other fleets based overseas. They are all taking a hard look at how to balance their operational requirements against eroding training and maintenance standards.“We found some things about risk that didn’t match what we thought, and we’re making changes in things we discovered,” Vice Adm. Kevin M. Donegan, commander of the Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain, said in a telephone interview.“When we have something like this happen, we do rigorous homework,” Admiral Donegan said. “We’re not standing fast.”There is little argument, however, that a shrinking Navy is performing the same duties that a larger fleet did a decade ago, and that constant deployments leave little time to train and maintain ships amid their relentless duties.Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told senators during a hearing on Tuesday about his visit to the Navy destroyer Barry several months ago, and of his learning that the ship had been at sea for 70 percent of the past 12 months.“When we go back now and we look at were they able to do all the training necessary, and what was their life like during those 12 months, 70 percent of the time underway is an unsustainable rate,” General Dunford said. “We’re going to have to make adjustments in the demand. That will incur managing operational and strategic risk, there’s no doubt.”Many of the changes in Admiral Rowden’s order smack of simple common sense.Hard to see and track electronically, naval vessels have long posed special perils to nighttime navigation. In addition to radar, all but the smallest commercial vessels use the so-called Automatic Identification Systems to broadcast information about their position, course and speed. Military vessels typically carry the systems but often turn them off because the captains do not want to reveal so much information. That will change under the new orders.“Successful mission accomplishment cannot be our sole measure of effectiveness,” Admiral Rowden said in his directive. “We must take greater heed of the manning, maintenance, training and certification pillars that collectively foster success.”Admiral Rowden also ordered standardized rules for watch teams on the bridge when the captain is not present; new reporting requirements for major equipment failures and near misses; and manually tracking vessels that come with 5,000 yards of a Navy ship to avoid collisions.The Navy has allowed ships to rely on grueling watch schedules that leave captains and crews exhausted, even though the service ordered submarines to abandon similar schedules two years ago. A Government Accountability Office report from May said sailors were on duty up to 108 hours each week.The new rules essentially will adopt studies by the Naval Postgraduate School to develop a shorter watch schedule to match circadian rhythms, which uses three hours of watch duty and nine hours off. Recognizing the benefits, the Navy ordered submarines to move to a similar schedule in 2015.Senators harrumphed last week that sleep-deprived sailors presented an obvious problem begging for a solution. “If we know that somebody’s working a 100-hour workweek, I’m not sure we need a study,” Mr. McCain said acidly."
"SAN FRANCISCO — President Trump took aim at Facebook on Wednesday, calling the social network “anti-Trump.” But the social network insists it is pro-democracy and pro-truth — and the German election shows it.The president’s post on Twitter added to the pressure that Facebook has been under, facing accusations of partisanship from both sides of the political aisle. The social network has been accused of spreading fake news that influenced the outcome of the presidential election last year, and more recently, it acknowledged that Russians used fake accounts and Facebook ads to push divisive issues during the campaign.“Trump says Facebook is against him,” Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, said in a post addressing Mr. Trump’s tweet. “Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like.”The accusations have left Facebook with something to prove: that it is ready for the next election.“Every day I work to bring people together and build a community for everyone,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “We hope to give all people a voice and create a platform for all ideas.”Mr. Zuckerberg expressed regret for initially appearing dismissive of his company’s potential effects on the 2016 election, saying that the topic was “too important.” But he also repeated a point he has made many times — that Facebook’s broader impact, “from giving people a voice to enabling candidates to communicate directly to helping millions of people vote,” had a much greater effect on the election than that of misinformation on the platform.But Facebook does not want to appear caught off guard again. To spread a message that it is more election-ready, the social network earlier on Wednesday leaned on its experience in Germany, which re-elected Angela Merkel to a fourth term as chancellor on Sunday.Facebook said  that it had taken roughly a dozen significant steps to combat misinformation on its site before the German elections, including deleting “tens of thousands” of Facebook accounts that it had suspected of being fake.“These actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election — but they did make it harder to spread, and less likely to appear in people’s News Feeds,” Richard Allan, Facebook’s vice president of public policy in Europe, said in a company blog post. “We learned a lot, and will continue to apply those lessons in other forthcoming elections.”Facebook’s influence on elections has been a much-discussed topic, spurred by how the social network has turned over information to Congress and federal investigators — including Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election — about Russia-linked political ads.The company has been trying to show that it is doing enough to combat misinformation and the misuse of its system in elections. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg addressed his network of more than 2 billion people about the social network’s role in democracies, specifically mentioning the work the company was doing to prepare for the German vote.“It is a new challenge for internet communities to deal with nation-states attempting to subvert elections,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “But if that’s what we must do, we are committed to rising to the occasion. We are in a new world.”Among the list of actions Facebook took in Germany, the company said, was the installation of programs to show people news articles offering different points of view on key issues. Facebook invited German news outlets into its Berlin offices to film broadcasts on its Facebook Live video service to report on the outcome of the election. And Germans who clicked on articles about the election on Facebook were given a list that laid out the positions of major political parties running for office.That Facebook’s influence did not heavily distort the German elections may also have been the result of other factors. Germans, like many regulators in the European Union, remain wary of abuse of their personal information and are far more suspicious of social media than Americans. While eight out of 10 Americans get their news from Facebook, only 5 out of 10 people do in Germany, according to figures gathered by the Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, or Foundation for New Responsibility. Of those Germans polled, only 6 percent said that Facebook was their main source of news.Television — particularly the country’s two public broadcasters — remains the most popular and trusted source of news for a majority of Germans, according to the foundation.Although some examples of fake news did emerge during the German election, they were quickly identified and debunked. Many of the leading news outlets organized fact-checking teams that examined the news and traced the sources for any material that seemed inflammatory or that had been flagged by the public.According to Alexander Sängerlaub, who led the foundation’s project for identifying fake news, stories that were discovered to be fake had largely been generated by individuals or organizations associated with the country’s far-right and populist movements. But when stories were found to have been fabricated or false, it proved harder to debunk them than it had been to circulate them, he said.Mr. Zuckerberg, in his announcement last week, said Facebook would work to be more transparent about the sources of political advertisements on the network, building tools to show users where the ads they see come from.Mr. Zuckerberg may have been attempting to pre-empt Congressional overtures toward regulation; currently, digital political advertisements seen on Facebook and other sites are not regulated, a stark contrast to television, print and radio political ads.In 2011, Facebook lobbied the Federal Election Commission for an exception that would not require the social network to carry disclaimers on political ads on its platform, according to F.E.C. documents reported on by CNN. Such disclaimers are a regular part of political advertisements on traditional media.“Facebook’s moves in European elections present as positive and I’m sure are appreciated globally,” said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a publishing industry trade organization. “But considering where we’ve been the past 18 months with Facebook’s denials and lack of transparency, everything must be considered a public relations play until we know a lot more.”"
"WASHINGTON — Unwilling to accept defeat, President Trump insisted on Wednesday that Republicans “have the votes” to dismantle much of the Affordable Care Act, and he predicted that the Senate would vote on legislation to do that in the first three months of next year.In the meantime, he said, he intends to negotiate with Democrats on a bipartisan health care bill and issue a “very major executive order,” probably next week. Under the order, Mr. Trump said, “people can go out, cross state lines, do lots of things and buy their own health care.”Millions of people could benefit, he said.Mr. Trump’s seemingly contradictory comments to journalists mystified members of both parties in both houses of Congress.Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, laughed when asked about Mr. Trump’s assertion that the votes were there for health care.“I’d like to know where they are,” Mr. Thune said. “He must be using a different calculator than the rest of us.”In the space of 10 minutes, the president said seven times that “we have the votes” on health care. But that appeared to be based on some erroneous or optimistic assumptions: That Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, was in the hospital and unavailable to vote, and that other Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were ready to vote yes.Mr. Cochran quickly corrected the president.“Thanks for the well-wishes. I’m not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon,” Mr. Cochran said on Twitter. The senator’s office said he had recently been treated for “a urological issue.”Even if Mr. Cochran had been in Washington this week, Senate Republicans would not have had the votes to pass the Graham-Cassidy bill. Three of the 52 Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Rand Paul of Kentucky — had announced that they opposed the measure, which had no support from Democrats.Ms. Murkowski said she had been unable to obtain “true, accurate data” about the bill’s effect on her state, which has exceptionally high health costs.Yet Mr. Trump said that statements issued by Ms. Murkowski and others showed that Republicans had nearly enough votes. “We were only one off, maybe two,” he said.Mr. Trump said that he was confident that the Senate would approve the guts of the Graham-Cassidy bill, which would give each state a lump sum of federal funds, in place of the money states receive under the Affordable Care Act for insurance subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid.“We will do the block grants,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday.As journalists asked Mr. Trump about other issues like taxes, the N.F.L. and new restrictions on foreign visitors, he kept returning to health care.“I feel we have the votes,” he said. “I’m almost certain we have the votes. But with one man in the hospital, we cannot display that we have them. Plus, some people want to go through a process just to make themselves feel better. That’s O.K.’’It was also not clear what bipartisan health care bill Mr. Trump had in mind.He recently struck a deal with the Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, on government spending and disaster relief funds, and he came close to an agreement with them on protections for young undocumented immigrants.Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, have been working on a bill to provide money for “cost sharing” subsidies for insurance companies. But some administration officials and some House Republicans have expressed deep reservations about that effort, which they say could prop up the Affordable Care Act.Republicans have long wanted to make it easier for people to buy heath insurance across state lines, in the belief that such purchases could hold down prices and increase competition. Mr. Paul said he had been working with the administration on a rules change that would allow people to band together and buy insurance thorough “association health plans” formed by trade associations and civic groups."
"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has aggressively pushed to dismantle regulations and downsize the organization, is threatening to reach outside his agency and undermine the Justice Department’s work enforcing antipollution laws, documents and interviews show.Under Mr. Pruitt, the E.P.A. has quietly said it may cut off a major funding source for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. Its lawyers handle litigation on behalf of the E.P.A.’s Superfund program seeking to force polluters to pay for cleaning up sites they left contaminated with hazardous waste. The E.P.A. reimburses the Justice Department for that work, paying more than $20 million annually in recent years, or enough for 115 full-time employees, budget documents show.But Mr. Pruitt has signaled that he wants to end those payments, potentially carving a major hole in the division’s budget, in a little-noticed line in the E.P.A.’s budget proposal in the spring. No decision will be made until Congress passes an E.P.A. budget for the fiscal year that begins in October, officials at both agencies said, although the payments were created by the executive branch, not Congress, so Mr. Pruitt may be able to act on his own. Congress hopes to pass a spending plan before a stopgap measure expires in mid-December.Mr. Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma with strong ties to the fossil fuel industry who frequently sued the E.P.A. before President Trump placed him in charge of it, has made no secret of his ambition to unwind its regulations and shrink its work force to curtail what he sees as federal overreach in protecting the environment and public health.The prospect of Mr. Pruitt expanding his efforts to the Justice Department has raised worries among employees in the Environment and Natural Resources Division about potential layoffs or furloughs and significant reductions in their work to fight pollution in the nation’s waterways, soil and air.Because they would continue to be responsible for pursuing Superfund cases, cutbacks would likely be spread across the division’s workload, which also includes suing oil companies, power plants and other corporations when they violate such antipollution laws as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act.Managers in the division have expressed hope that Justice Department leaders may come up enough offsetting funds to forestall drastic measures.The funding arrangement, which dates to the Reagan administration, is not created by statute. Instead, the E.P.A. pays the Justice Department under an agreement reached by earlier leaders of the two agencies, and which Mr. Pruitt is now considering abandoning.The funding has allowed the division to expand its work beyond what its congressional appropriation alone would permit. Between 1987 and 2016, the E.P.A.’s reimbursements provided over $810 million to the division, amounting to 27 percent of its budget, according to a recent audit.Congressional appropriations aides in both parties said that skepticism has emerged on Capitol Hill over Mr. Pruitt’s idea. Still, the extent to which the Republican-controlled Congress would tie his hands remains to be seen.Asked how the Justice Department would deal with the shortfall if Mr. Pruitt follows through, Wyn Hornbuckle, a department spokesman, did not directly answer the question.“While the environment division continues to examine areas to achieve efficiencies and cost savings, we anticipate adequate funding to continue our core mission in safeguarding clean air, clean land and clean water for all Americans, including the important work on the nation’s Superfund sites,” he said in a statement.He did not say which parts of the division’s work the Trump administration considers part of its core mission as opposed to inefficiencies ripe for cost savings.Under Mr. Pruitt, the E.P.A. proposed cutting one-third of its $8 billion budget, including slashing its Superfund program by $327 million, or about 30 percent. As part of that reduction, it proposed cutting enforcement — efforts to identify the parties responsible for leaving sites contaminated and to try to make them pay for cleanup — by $67 million.Amid expectations that  enforcement resources would be diminished, the E.P.A. made its little-noticed announcement in its budget proposal that it intended to no longer reimburse the Justice Department for Superfund litigation costs, meaning the department would have to start paying for that work out of its own funds.By contrast, the  proposal submitted by the Justice Department anticipated that the Environment and Natural Resources Division would receive $25.97 million in E.P.A. reimbursements. It was not clear why the Trump administration submitted conflicting proposals.In a statement, Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pruitt, called this article “yet another conspiracy theory by The New York Times to draw space in the administration that doesn’t exist,” while saying said that a final decision would come after Congress passes a 2018 budget.“The budget process continues to play out,” she said. “E.P.A. has not threatened D.O.J. with anything. We value the contributions made by E.N.R.D. attorneys over the years to E.P.A.’s work, continue to value that relationship and acknowledge that final funding decisions will be made once Congress acts.”But Environment and Natural Resources Division supervisors have been discussing for months what to do if Mr. Pruitt withdraws the funding, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. Among other things, they have asked whether it might be possible to shrink the gap using money from a fund that takes a cut of proceeds from civil debt collection litigation, an internal document shows.Although the Senate has not taken up a 2018 budget bill for the E.P.A., the House of Representatives passed its version this month. While it would cut the E.P.A.’s overall budget by about $500 million — less than Mr. Pruitt wanted — it would also slightly increase the $1.1 billion Superfund program, and an accompanying appropriations committee report says the program’s activities should generally continue.However, the report also instructs the E.P.A. to trim spending on Superfund enforcement by $12 million without saying how. A Democratic appropriations staff member said the legislation is ambiguous enough that Mr. Pruitt could take advantage of it to curtail reimbursements to the Justice Department.The House Appropriations Committee does not support cutting off the Justice Department reimbursements, a spokeswoman for the Republican staff said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss legislation whose details are still in flux, as did the Democratic aide.The Republican aide acknowledged that the current bill would leave the E.P.A. with discretion to decide where to cut its enforcement spending, but suggested that a final spending bill may provide more detailed instructions.Ms. Bowman, the spokeswoman for the E.P.A., did not respond to follow-up questions, including whether Mr. Pruitt believed the current legislation would tie his hands."
